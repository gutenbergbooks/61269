<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>These lectures each had a set of associated slides, a complete
list of which can be found on pages <a href="#Page_117">117&ndash;124</a> at the end of the book.
These slide sets were sold separately and are not part of the book.
Some of the slides (those highlighted in <b>bold</b> in the slide list) were
inserted as illustrations in the original book, and these are reproduced in this etext.</p>

<p class="screenonly">The numbers in the right margin of the etext are the numbers of
the associated slides. Several of these margin slide numbers are in parentheses ( ) to
indicate that this particular slide is being shown for a second time at this point in
the lecture. These margin slide numbers, like the page numbers, are only displayed
on browsers; they are not displayed on handheld ereader devices.</p>

<p class="screenonly">If the window viewing size is made very wide, some slide numbers
might be overlaid on the next one; keeping the text width less than 120 characters
should avoid this.</p>

<p class="handonly">The original book showed all the slide numbers as sidenotes in the outer
margin of the text. These are not displayed on ereaders, but can be viewed in the .htm and .txt
versions of the etext.</p>

<p>There are no Footnotes in this book.</p>

<p>Some minor changes to the text are noted at <a href="#TN">the end of the book</a>.</p>

<p class="pfs135 lsp bold">PREFACE.</p>


<p class="drop-capy">The plan of these lectures is due to Mr. H. J. Mackinder,
who wrote the series of lectures on India.
The author of the present series is Mr. A. J. Sargent, and
the lectures have been revised on behalf of the Visual
Instruction Committee by Sir Everard im Thurn and
Sir Charles Lucas. The slides are mainly derived from
pictures painted and photographs taken by Mr. A. Hugh
Fisher on behalf of the Committee, supplemented by photographs
supplied from various sources. The Committee
have gratefully to acknowledge the abundant help which
they have received in this respect.</p>

<p>The next series to be issued will be on Australasia, and
the lectures are already well advanced.</p>

hundred millions of Asia are crowded into the southeastern
corner. Between the two, from the Red Sea
coast of Arabia to the western boundary of China, lies
a broad band of desert and steppe, mountain and plateau,
thinly peopled and difficult to cross. On the north,
the sea passage is barred by the ice of the Arctic; while
the only land link between west and east is the thin
line of the Siberian railway. But on the south, from <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</span>
the Baltic to the Sea of Japan, is a broad highway, free
to all and within easy reach of the great trading nations
of Europe and Asia. From end to end we see it running
along the coasts and through inland seas; so that ships
are rarely out of sight of land for many days together.
At frequent intervals are straits to be passed and corners
to be turned by every ship; and here, where the sea
road must touch the land, are the key points for trade
in time of peace or strategy in time of war.</p>

<p>Britain is responsible for the government of over
three hundred million Asiatics and carries on a great
trade with the remainder; in fact, about two-thirds of
the merchant shipping passing through the Suez Canal
is under the British flag. We have important interests,
too, on the eastern side of Africa, while a new Britain,
British in race and political organization, is growing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in Australasia. We are the chief users of the main road
to this region of the world, and are thus most interested
in its condition and control.</p>

<p>For ships sailing from the western coasts of Europe,
otherwise than round the Cape of Good Hope, the only
gateway to the long passage to the East is the Strait
of Gibraltar, at its narrowest a little less than half
as broad as the Strait of Dover. Let us look for a <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 2</span>
moment at the map. We have passed Capes St. Vincent
and Trafalgar, and as we turn in from the Atlantic,
far away on our right is Cape Spartel, the corner of
Africa, and beside it the Moroccan port of Tangier.
We had interests on this coast in times past, since Tangier
was a British Possession more than two centuries ago.
It came to the English Crown not by conquest but as
part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza, wife of
Charles II; but after twenty years it was abandoned
to the Moors as useless. Bombay also was included in
the dowry: but how different is its later history!</p>

<p>We are now inside the Strait; on our left, just at the
point where the shores of Europe approach most nearly
to Africa, stands the Spanish fortress of Tarifa. Here,
where it is narrowest, we might expect to find the controlling
point of the gateway; but we must look beyond.
Further east the Strait begins to broaden out until it
loses itself suddenly in the open waters of the Mediterranean,
where the coasts of Spain and Africa trend
away sharply to north and south. Here, on a narrow
spur running southwards, with the open sea to the east
and the bay and town of Algeciras to the west, lies
the Rock of Gibraltar. Fourteen miles away to the
south, on another jutting point, is the town of Ceuta,
which belongs to Spain. Five towns keep guard over
the gateway to the Mediterranean, but only one holds
the key; we may understand this better when we have
learnt something of Gibraltar and its history.</p>

<p>We think and speak of the Rock rather than the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
or bay; with good reason, since Gibraltar without the
Rock would be of small value to us. As we steam in <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
from the west we see it rising from the water like an
island block broken off from the mountains of Spain. <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 4</span>
Now we are drawing nearer and the block begins to take
shape. A long ridge, carved out into detached peaks,
drops sharply to the north where the low flat isthmus,
scarcely visible, links it
with the mainland. On
our right hand, towards
the south, it descends in
steps to the narrow point
on which we can just see
the lighthouse. With a
little use of the imagination
we may liken the
ridge to a crouching beast
keeping guard over the
waters of the Strait below.
Now the houses of the <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 5</span>
town begin to show
against the dark background
of hill, and soon
we pass a cruiser at
anchor and enter the new
harbour, with its docks
and coaling wharves enclosed
in protecting
moles.</p>

<p>We have seen Gibraltar
on the west from the
level of the sea; let us <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
turn to the map for a
moment and take a bird’s-eye glance at the whole
peninsula with its surroundings.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Gibraltar.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The Rock is small: its length three miles from north
to south, its greatest breadth not more than three-quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of a mile. Its area is a little less than two
square miles, so that it is quite the smallest in the list of
our foreign possessions. A high and narrow ridge, rising
over a thousand feet, falls steeply to the land on the
north and to the sea on the east; towards the south,
where the ridge is lower, it ends in cliffs against which
the sea beats always and prevents all access. On part
of the west side the lower slopes are more gentle, and
on these lies the town with the harbour at the foot.</p>

<p>Let us look now at the approach to Gibraltar from <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
the mainland of Spain. Here we see a corner of the
northwest face of the rock, where it overlooks the isthmus.
Notice how sheer it rises from the plain, with the flooded
moat at its foot. The narrow road, on which we are
standing, between the Rock and the sea margin, is the
sole entry to the fortress, and we may understand how,
in a spot such as this, a small force could easily defy an <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
army. Here is another view of the Causeway, from
the hill above, which shows us how narrow is the link
connecting the Rock with the mainland. Gibraltar is,
in effect, an island; the only real approach is on the
west, from the sea.</p>

<p>We will now explore further. All round us are guns
and fortifications old and new; soldiers are everywhere;
we can see little without special permission, and the
authorities are very inquisitive as to our business. The
main gates are locked and guarded at night, and we
take the time and set our watches by gunfire. We
soon learn that we are in no ordinary town, but in a
fortress prepared for war. Here we see one of the hot <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
and narrow streets. In the foreground is one of the
olive-skinned natives of the Mediterranean. We shall
find them everywhere about the harbour; in fact they
seem far too many for a small confined town. But in
the evening we may meet them streaming away by the
north gate, bound for the Spanish town of Linea, which
is visible in the distance beyond the neutral ground of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the isthmus. There is much work to be done in the
harbour, but there is no room for the town to expand,
so it is not possible to house the workmen on the spot.
It is necessary to limit the number of civilians living in
the town, for past experience has proved that they are
a danger to health in time of peace, through overcrowding,
and a source of weakness to the fighting garrison in time
of war. Gibraltar must be governed purely as a fortress;
its history is a history of war; in time of peace it has
little interest.</p>

<p>Thirteen sieges in five centuries are recorded by historians
since its capture from the Moors by Ferdinand
of Castile in 1309; a relic of the Moorish occupation <span class="linenum">10</span>
still survives in the old castle which we see here;
of the sieges the last three alone concern us. In the
autumn of 1704, only a few months after a British
admiral had hoisted the flag and claimed the Rock in
the name of Queen Anne, France and Spain with a
great fleet and army attempted its recovery. In the
spring of the next year the garrison, without food
or powder, reduced by disease and fighting to less than
1,500 effective men, and facing the constant attack of
a vastly superior force, could scarcely hope to hold out
much longer. But relief at last came from the sea. A
British squadron broke through the blockading fleets
and brought supplies and reinforcements; and though
it sailed away again the real siege was over. On the
land side the Rock was impregnable; the guns of that
day were useless against its defences; Gibraltar was
ours to hold so long as we could command the sea.</p>

<p>At the peace of Utrecht, which ended the war of the
Spanish Succession, we retained Gibraltar, and the people
of England, impressed by the siege and the splendid
defence of the Rock, resolved to keep it. It was only
natural that Spain should wish to recover a fortress
which was geographically part of her territory and of
little value to us at the time. For years her diplomatists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
tried to persuade us to restore it; and when diplomacy
failed, force was attempted once more. In 1728, great
preparations were made for another siege; even Cadiz
was stripped of its guns to provide a siege train, and an
army of 20,000 men fronted the little garrison of 1,500.
The Government in England set small value on the place,
so that the defences had been utterly neglected. The
guns were worn out and the fortifications in decay, but
the garrison worked day and night in parties of 500 to
repair the damage. A heavy bombardment undid much
of their work, but it also ruined the large brass guns of
the enemy, while month by month we poured in men
and supplies from the sea, until the garrison was raised
to over 5,000. The siege proved that Gibraltar, properly
manned, had nothing to fear from an assault by land,
and the people of England were more than ever convinced
that it was quite impregnable. The real danger
was to come fifty years later, when we lost for a time the
command of the sea.</p>

<p>The last and greatest siege began in 1779, when the
fortunes of England were at a low ebb in the war of
American Independence, and a French and Spanish
fleet had sailed with impunity up the English Channel.
In spite of despatches from Governors and discussions
in Parliament, the defences of Gibraltar were again in
a thoroughly neglected state. It is not to the English
Ministers or Parliament that we owe our present possession
of it, but to the energy and foresight of General
Eliott, the Governor at the time. It is true that at the
last moment we hurried out more troops and supplies;
but when the attack began in June, 1779, the garrison,
with no hope of further relief from the sea, was ill fitted
to withstand a long siege by the joint forces of France
and Spain.</p>

<p>Let us climb up to one of the great galleries begun <span class="linenum">11</span>
during the siege and hewn out of the solid limestone
rock, with their rows of gun-ports like windows in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
face of the precipice. Let us look out through one of <span class="linenum">12</span>
these windows and try to imagine the scene in the days
of the siege. Here we have a fine view of the country <span class="linenum">13</span>
below. The blank space, without houses, which we see
is the neutral ground, and beyond it the besiegers’ lines
were drawn right across the isthmus. Across this narrow
space the guns fired round shot, the enemy attacked
and the garrison made sorties. Further away is the
town of Linea, and right under our feet is the goal of the
attack, the narrow entrance to the fortress itself. But
the scenes on the isthmus can never be repeated; long-range
artillery has changed the conditions of warfare;
the heavy guns on the landward side of the Rock now
keep watch and ward over the distant hills.</p>

<p>This was the view of the besieged on the land side;
the sea also was closed to them. Our fleets were engaged
elsewhere and supplies were cut off by a swarm of hostile
cruisers in the Strait. The troops were on half rations
from the first, while at the end of a twelvemonth the
people were glad to search the Rock for wild roots and
weeds. Gibraltar was never nearer to surrender. At
the last moment, Rodney, on his way to the West Indies,
defeated the Spanish fleet off Cape St. Vincent and
brought in a convoy. But he could not stay, and the
siege closed in for a second year. Morocco joined Spain,
so that the small supplies which had reached the garrison
in spite of the blockade were now cut off. To crown
all, the food brought from England was mostly salted,
and scurvy broke out. To add to the trials of the defence,
the enemy now attacked from the sea with small gunboats
rowed in close to the shore under cover of darkness.
The town was a fair target which they could hardly miss,
while they were small and offered no chance in the darkness
to the gunners of the garrison. So for the rest of
the siege this nightly bombardment went on unchecked,
as to reply was mere waste of powder which could ill
be spared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>In the spring of 1781, a powerful English fleet again
brought relief, and later in the year a brilliant sortie by
the garrison ended in the destruction of the besiegers’
lines and delayed the final attack. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Bu  early in'">But early in</ins> 1782
Minorca surrendered to the French, who were thus set
free to prepare for a great joint effort. For a time there
was a lull in the storm, while ships were collected in the
bay and men and stores on the mainland. Rewards
were offered for the best plan for capturing the fortress,
and people came from all over Europe to watch the final
act in the great drama. The preparations ended in
a grand assault by land and sea in September, 1782. For
four days without ceasing thirty thousand men with
nearly three hundred guns attacked from the isthmus.
In the Bay were fifty warships with the gunboats and
the famous floating batteries. To oppose this huge armament
with its five hundred guns or more, the defenders
had some eight thousand men and less than a hundred
guns. It was enough. How the attack failed is told
in every history. It is worth remark that the losses of
the garrison in the bombardment were very small, not
more than might have been expected in a mere skirmish.
The guns of those days were of little use against the
natural defences of the Rock. Soon after, Lord Howe, in
the teeth of the combined fleets, broke the blockade and
brought the third relief; and although the fighting continued
for a time, the real siege was over as soon as the
English fleet had forced the passage of the Strait.</p>

<p>When we think of these sieges, we can perhaps understand
better why Gibraltar, rather than any of the other
four towns, holds the key to the Strait. When our
fleet was away the fortress was powerless and the enemy
could close the passage. A fleet alone could keep it
open, but a fleet, now as then, must have a harbour
close at hand as a base. In the case of Gibraltar only
of the five towns do we find both fortress and fleet together.</p>

<p>The history of Gibraltar in the nineteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
has been mainly concerned with the difficulties of governing
its miscellaneous population and the problem of
improving the defences and adapting them to the ever-changing
conditions of modern warfare. Towards the
end of the century the need of further dock accommodation
for the fleet became pressing. The new harbour
was begun in 1893, but while it was in course of construction
the science of artillery was also making great progress,
and it has been pointed out that the docks could be
assailed by the fire from long-range guns hidden behind
the hills on the mainland. So from the purely military
point of view the fortress is perhaps less impregnable
than in former times.</p>

<p>In the matter of internal administration there has been
much improvement. Gibraltar has gained a bad reputation
in the past for climate and health. The bare rock
adds to the burning heat of the summer sun; the town is
shut off from fresh breezes by the hill, and when the
Levanter blows from the east, and heavy clouds hang
over the summit of the ridge, the clammy air makes
the heat still more oppressive. There have been severe
epidemics on the Rock, due largely to the bad drainage
of the old town and the want of sufficient water. Most
of the rain falls in the winter months, and a heavy downpour
is soaked up at once by the porous rock. There
are no springs, so the water is collected in tanks from the
roofs of the houses, while the authorities have built
reservoirs and artificial catches on the lower hill slopes
and have set up condensing engines as a reserve in time <span class="linenum">14</span>
of need. Here is one of these catches on the north peak
above Catalan Bay; it is made of sheets of corrugated
iron, coated with cement, and lies like a roof over the
porous sand beneath. There are wells, too, on the low
ground to the north; but the water is brackish and not
good for drinking. Better drainage and more water have
greatly changed the condition of the town; so that the
water famines and epidemics of the past are not likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to recur; but food must always be imported, as there is
no room to grow it on the Rock, with its small area and
poor soil.</p>

<p>Yet all is not bare and dry, as we shall see if we continue <span class="linenum">15</span>
our tour of the peninsula. We drive through the old
south gate to the Alameda gardens, the beauty spot of <span class="linenum">16</span>
Gibraltar. Here are shaded walks and open spaces as
in an English park, though many of the plants are strange
to us. But we are even here reminded of the fortress, <span class="linenum">17</span>
since on the level parade ground we see the troops of the
garrison at drill in the cool of the early morning. Our <span class="linenum">18</span>
road runs through a grove of trees; there is the southern
suburb in front of us, and below as we turn round is spread <span class="linenum">19</span>
out the harbour and dockyard, with the calm bay of Algeciras
beyond. We pass more old fortifications spanning <span class="linenum">20</span>
the road, and come out above Europa point, the southern
outlook of the Rock. Here is the lighthouse, which we <span class="linenum">21</span>
saw from the steamer, standing on the low cliffs. We
have left the trees behind us and all is bare and windswept;
but the fresh breeze brings relief after the
stifling heat of the town, and so in this corner the Governor <span class="linenum">22</span>
has his summer cottage. Here is a view taken from it.
We continue our walk round the eastern side of the point, <span class="linenum">23</span>
past the old batteries, only to find that the path ends
suddenly, where the hill comes sheer down into the sea.
As we have a special permit, let us climb the heights
and see what is beyond the corner. The narrow ridge <span class="linenum">24</span>
with its sharp peaks stretches away to the north; we
are looking along its steep eastern slope. Down below,
in a little hollow, hemmed in by the sea and the hill, is <span class="linenum">25</span>
the village of Catalan Bay, with its colony of Genoese
fishermen, descendants of those who settled on the Rock
when the Spanish inhabitants left it two centuries ago. <span class="linenum">26</span>
Here are the fishermen and their boats at close quarters.
Beyond the bay is a long line of surf beating on the low
eastern shore of the isthmus, and in the distance, hidden
by the mists, the range of the Sierra Nevada. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> <span class="linenum">27</span>
middle peak is the signal station, with the old wall of
Charles V. running down the hillside; and behind it the
aërial line joining the station to the town. Here ends
our journey. The signal station is the eye of Gibraltar,
ever watching the sea and the Strait, and ready to give
instant warning of an enemy’s coming to the guns and
ships below.</p>

<p>We think of Gibraltar to-day as one of the most valuable
and necessary links in the chain of communication
with the East; yet in the eighteenth century, some of
the most patriotic and far-seeing among English
statesmen were ready and even eager to restore it to
Spain. Over and over again it was offered in exchange
for some other place, or as a bribe for the Spanish alliance.
In 1728, the Cabinet was prepared to surrender
it without any return; Lord Townshend, writing to
our ambassador, explains why they hesitated. “I am
afraid that the bare mention of a proposal which carried
the most distant appearance of laying England under
an obligation of ever parting with that place would be
sufficient to put the whole nation in a flame.” Even
in 1783, after the great siege, we proposed to exchange
Gibraltar for Porto Rico. The policy of our ministers
was not so unreasonable as it seems at first sight. Our
trade with the Near East was not increasing, and we
had no special interests in the Mediterranean, so that it
seemed a waste of strength to maintain a costly fortress
there, when all that we could spare was needed for the
defence of our distant dominions. In fact, France seemed
to be the Power marked out by her history and geographical
position as the natural ruler of the inland sea; and
it was the sentiment of the English people rather than
any practical justification in the conditions of the time
which made us cling obstinately to our conquest.</p>

<p>We may realize more clearly the place of Gibraltar in
British policy if we turn for a moment to another outpost
in this region, which we held for most of the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
century. Minorca was captured soon after Gibraltar,
and the two were commonly associated since they both
served a like purpose. Gibraltar divided Carthagena <span class="linenum">28</span>
from Cadiz, and Toulon from Brest; it was a bar to the
union of the Mediterranean and Atlantic fleets of France or
Spain. But in the eighteenth century France was the
more dangerous enemy, and from the point of view of
our relations with France, Minorca was more valuable
than Gibraltar. Minorca had no land attack to fear
and was better placed than Gibraltar for keeping guard
over Toulon, the great arsenal of the French navy in
the Mediterranean. The value of both stations lay in
their influence on our fights in the Atlantic and the
English Channel, since our road to India was round the
Cape and we had no thought of the Mediterranean as
an alternative. At the end of the century the eyes of
British ministers were opened, when Gibraltar became
associated not with Minorca but with Malta. It was
Napoleon Bonaparte who first directed our policy towards
Egypt and drove us to the occupation of Malta.</p>

<p>In 1797, Minorca was no longer ours; we had retired
from Corsica and Elba after a short occupation, and
not a single British warship was to be seen east of Gibraltar;
the Mediterranean became for a time a French
lake. Napoleon had been waiting and planning for this,
and at once started on his great expedition to Egypt
and the East. The expedition was part of a far-reaching
design: Egypt was to be colonized by France, a canal
cut through the Isthmus of Suez, and England to be
attacked by way of India, while the Dutch and Spanish
fleets kept us busy in the North Sea and the Atlantic.
The defeat of the Dutch off Camperdown and of the Spanish
off Cape St Vincent upset this elaborate plan, and in
the spring of 1798 Nelson was in the Mediterranean.
The French had a week’s start; their destination was
uncertain. They were expected in Ireland, Sicily, Portugal;
anywhere but in Egypt. Napoleon had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Egypt for a month when Nelson’s long search ended in
the battle of the Nile and the consequent cutting off of
the French from their supports at home.</p>

<p>Malta had been occupied by the French without
trouble, as there was treachery within the walls; it
needed two years of blockade by the Maltese people,
aided by our fleet, to compel the garrison to surrender.
Still we did not realize its value. At the peace of Amiens
we agreed to give it back under guarantees to the Knights
of St. John, in spite of the strong protests of the Maltese.
We prepared to withdraw our troops, but changed our
plans at the last moment, through suspicion of Napoleon’s
design; and the island remained in our possession with
the full concurrence and goodwill of its inhabitants.
When the war broke out again, the French occupied
Italy; but Sicily was guarded by the British fleet and
was used by us as a base from which to harry the French
on the mainland and cut off their supplies by sea. It was
a fine object-lesson in the value of a secure island base
in these waters as an aid to the command of the sea.</p>

<p>A glance at the map will make clear the importance <span class="linenum">29</span>
of the position of Malta. It lies midway between Gibraltar
and Port Said, the entrance and exit of the Mediterranean,
where Sicily stretching out towards the projecting
corner of Africa divides the long narrow sea into
two distinct basins. The entry to the eastern half is
either by the broad passage between Cape Bon and
Sicily, or by the narrow strait of Messina. Malta
blocks the one passage and is within easy reach of the
other.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Valetta Harbour.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Gibraltar has been made by the Rock; its harbour
is modern and artificial; but the harbour of Valetta is
as old as the island and was used long before the town <span class="linenum">30</span>
existed. Here is a plan of the harbour: we see that it
consists of two deep inlets with a spur between on which
stands the main town. The entrance is narrow, and
thus easily defended, while the inlets run far into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
land and offer safe anchorage for the largest vessels. The
southern inlet, partly closed by a long breakwater, forms <span class="linenum">31</span>
the Grand Harbour, into which we are steaming. On
our right, at the corner above the breakwater, is the castle <span class="linenum">32</span>
of St. Elmo: on our left is fort Ricasoli, guarding the
entrance. Higher up are fort St. Angelo, on a jutting  <span class="linenum">33</span>
peninsula, and other forts and bastions on every
point of vantage; while the main town and suburbs
are encircled on the land side with ramparts and deep <span class="linenum">34</span>
trenches. Here is a view towards the harbour mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which gives a good picture of the old town. The view
is from the upper <em>Baracca</em>, where the old knights of <span class="linenum">35</span>
Malta used to walk to take the air. Here is another
view from the lower <em>Baracca</em>, but looking up the harbour.
In the harbour a long line of warships lies at anchor,
and from the water’s edge the town rises up in steep
streets and terraces. Let us climb up one of the main <span class="linenum">36</span>
streets leading from the water front. It is not an ordinary
roadway, but a staircase with shallow steps of stone, owing
to the steepness of the hill. The tall houses, with
their weathered yellow stone, their carved fronts and
overhanging balconies, and their heavily barred windows
looking out on the street, might well belong to some old
Italian city. The whole city has an air of dignity and
age which we should hardly expect to find in a small
and isolated island. Even the great forts suggest mediæval
history and romance, armour and swords, rather
than bayonets and quick-firing guns. They are very
different from the batteries of Gibraltar. In fact, Valetta
is far more than a mere fortress; it has a history, a
people and a language all its own. The upper classes
have been affected by contact with the Latin races of
Southern Europe, while there is a strong Arab strain in
the mass of the people; but all alike are Maltese, proud
of their country and clinging tenaciously to their old
customs and language. Here we see a portrait of a <span class="linenum">37</span>
gentleman of pure Maltese descent, and here again a
Maltese lady, wearing the <em>faldetta</em>, or hooded cloak, a <span class="linenum">38</span>
remnant of national costume. The hood is still worn
very generally by ladies in the street, and we may perhaps
connect it with the Eastern custom of concealing the
face, though it is not always used for this purpose by
the Maltese, and their own tradition traces its origin
to the insults of the French soldiers at the time of the
occupation.</p>

<p>Malta is the meeting-place of East and West, and its
position in the Mediterranean has determined its destiny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
From the beginning of history every dominant race in
the Mediterranean has held it at one time or another.
Romans and Carthaginians fought for it: the Arabs
occupied it for two centuries and left their mark on the
language and the people: then came the Normans in
the eleventh century and brought it into close contact
with Europe; and finally, in 1530, it was handed over
by the Emperor Charles V. to the Knights of St. John of
Jerusalem, better known as the Hospitallers, who had
been driven from Rhodes, their earlier home, after a
great siege by the Turks. Thus Malta became an outpost
of Christendom, barring Mohammedan progress
westward, and a safe base for the knights in the perpetual
war which they waged against the infidel in the eastern
Mediterranean. It is no matter for surprise that three
times in the course of twenty years the Turks besieged
the knights with powerful armies; though each time they
were beaten back with great slaughter. At the date of the
third attack, in 1565, La Valette was Grand Master of the
Order. On the retreat of the Turks he founded the new
town of Valetta, round the harbour and forts which he
had so well defended. The Order was wealthy, with
vast possessions in Europe; princes and prelates contributed
money as a thank-offering for victory over the
Turk, and crowds of skilled workmen were brought over
from the mainland. So the new city grew, with its
fortifications and palaces, a fit home for a knightly
aristocracy which was distinguished alike for its prowess
in war and for its luxury in time of peace.</p>

<p>The city remains much as it was. The Grand Master’s <span class="linenum">39</span>
palace is now the residence of the Governor; here in the
armoury we can still see the armour and weapons of its <span class="linenum">40</span>
former owners. At Citta Vecchia, the former capital,
we find the old Court of Justice converted into a hospital. <span class="linenum">41</span>
Here again is the house of one of the knights made
useful as a government school, and here the Auberge, <span class="linenum">42</span>
or club house, of the knights of Castile in the occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of the Royal Artillery; while the beautiful cathedral of <span class="linenum">43</span>
St. John, built by the knights, still stands to remind us
of the combination of religion and fighting which was so
characteristic of the mediæval world. We can still <span class="linenum">44</span>
see, also, the great aqueduct, built to bring water to the
city from the distant springs. Everywhere we have
preserved and adapted the work of the knights, so that
Malta is a picture of the past for the most part unspoiled.</p>

<p>Outside the towns there is little to see in Malta. Here <span class="linenum">45</span>
is a view across the country, and here a wider view from the
ramparts of Citta Vecchia; it looks dreary enough, with <span class="linenum">46</span>
high stone walls crossing it in every direction with a few
cypresses showing above them, and here and there a grove
of olives. The walls are necessary, as the island is exposed
to every wind that blows, and above all to the <em>gregale</em>,
the boisterous north-east storm wind. Even more
unpleasant is the Sirocco, a warm damp wind which
blows in late summer and early autumn from the Sahara.
The summer is hot, and usually without a cloud; and
though heavy rains fall in the winter, they quickly soak
into the porous rock. Though it seems so bare and rocky
and the soil is thin, yet Malta is well cultivated and produces
splendid crops on its little farms. But there are
too many people for its small area, since the whole
Maltese group is only about half as large again as the
Channel Islands; and as the Maltese are loath to emigrate,
much food must be imported, and large quantities <span class="linenum">47</span>
of grain are stored for emergency in the old underground
granaries which we see here, hewn from the solid rock. <span class="linenum">48</span>
Everything is of stone in Malta; the island is one great
mass of limestone with the thinnest covering of soil. We
may cross the open country by the narrow gauge railway <span class="linenum">49</span>
and enter Citta Vecchia by the old gateway. The place
seems sleepy and lifeless, since its people have migrated
to Valetta. There are relics in it of very early days; <span class="linenum">50</span>
a Norman house which we may recognize by the shape
of its doors and windows, and even still older, the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> <span class="linenum">51</span>
of a Roman villa. But even here, in this quaint old town,
we find soldiers of the Maltese regiment at drill, to remind <span class="linenum">52</span>
us that a fortress is not far away.</p>

<p>We will now leave Valetta, with its harbour and forts,
its close-packed houses and busy streets, to visit another <span class="linenum">53</span>
island of the Maltese group, more thinly populated than
Malta and more old-fashioned and rural. We sail northward
along the coast, past the deep bay which tradition
connects with the wreck of St. Paul, past the islet of
Comino, with its solitary castle, lying in mid-channel,
and reach the landing-place of Gozo. Here, on the side
facing Malta, the coast is low; but the rest of the island is
bordered by steep limestone cliffs, hollowed out into caves
and grottos. One of these our guide will show us as the
very cave of Calypso described by Homer. We land and <span class="linenum">54</span>
drive towards the old capital, Rabato, re-named Victoria,
which lies in the centre of the island, like the old capital of
Malta; but there is no deep inlet on the coast to give rise to
another Valetta. From the walls of the old castle, close to <span class="linenum">55</span>
the cathedral, we can look across the same flat country, cut
up into pieces by stone walls, which we saw in Malta. But <span class="linenum">56</span>
the countryside is brighter; on our drive to Rabato we
pass gardens where vegetables are grown for the Valetta
market; thick hedges of scarlet geranium; fields of tall
spiked red clover and banks of wild thyme and vetch.
Gozo has been noted for its honey from very early times,
and there is abundance of food here for the bees. Everywhere
are herds of goats tended by half-clad children,
and outside the houses we may see whole families of <span class="linenum">57</span>
women and girls busy making lace. The Maltese lace
which we buy comes mainly from Gozo, where the industry
has existed for thousands of years. Here is one of the <span class="linenum">58</span>
old houses; notice its curious eastern look; we shall
find that even the language seems to differ somewhat from
that of the Maltese and to be allied more to Arabic.</p>

<p>We are in an old-fashioned world, with little to remind
us of Europe except the churches and the decaying fortifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of Rabato. But before the Arabs, before the
Romans, and perhaps even before the Phœnicians, there
were people in these islands who have left strange traces
of their occupation. In both islands are to be found fragments
of very ancient enclosures or temples, built of huge <span class="linenum">59</span>
stones piled together without mortar, such as we have in
these two pictures. It may be that the race of these old <span class="linenum">60</span>
builders still survives to some degree in the Maltese, and
they may well be proud to believe that they have been
tenants of the islands without a break from before the beginning
of the history of the races of modern Europe. Whatever
the exact origin of the Maltese may be, in speaking
of Malta and Gibraltar together we are certainly linking
the very old with the very new. Gibraltar has no real
native people and no continuous history; even from the
point of view of naval strategy it is essentially modern.
Malta was a naval base in the days when trade and civilization
were confined to the Mediterranean; the opening
of the Suez Canal has merely added to its former importance.
Gibraltar only comes into history when western
civilization has spread to the outer seas and the broad
Atlantic.</p>

<span class="fs80">MALTA TO ADEN</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">On our voyage from the English Channel to Malta we
are never out of touch with the countries of Western
Europe. Even on the African coast European influence
or control is becoming stronger every year. We have
seen how our occupation of Gibraltar was incidental
to our quarrels with France and Spain, and these same
quarrels, in the end, brought Malta into our possession.
But Malta is on the edge of the Near East, and in looking
at its history in mediæval times we were always
concerned with the rivalry of the West with the East,
Europe with Asia. So even to-day, though Europe has
proved itself the stronger, we shall find that beyond
Malta we enter a new world where the relations of West
and East are not yet finally settled. This uncertainty
is shown alike in our own position and in that of the
other great Powers of Europe. The problem of the
Near East is still one of the chief worries of diplomats
and governments.</p>

<p>From Malta to Aden is perhaps the most important
section of the great trade route which we are following;
yet right through, from the entrance of the Eastern Mediterranean
to the outlet of the Red Sea, in spite of our
great commercial and political interests, we shall not
find a single acre of British freehold territory. Even
as far as Malta we can only claim that part of the road
is British, since, in time of peace, the important mail <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 1</span>
traffic goes through France and Italy, from Calais to
Brindisi. In fact, for our complete traffic, in passengers,
mails, goods and ships, we might regard Aden as the
first British station on the road to India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>So, at the European end of the journey, owing to the
modern development of rapid transit, we are more and
more dependent on the kindly offices of foreign nations.
Beyond Malta conditions are different. Though we
have no freehold possessions, the waterway is free to
all, and we have agreements and rights of various kinds
affecting its use and control. We must learn something
of these rights, since Malta and Aden lose half
their meaning for us unless we understand the nature
of our interests in the intervening links in the long chain
of communication.</p>

<p>As we steam eastward from Malta, on our way to Port <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 2</span>
Said, we may pass within sight of the island of Crete.
Here we are entering on the new region, as Crete has
relations both with Europe and with Asia, and the ultimate
form of these relations is still in doubt. Crete
is a debatable ground between Turkey and Greece, and
Britain is concerned with three other European Powers
in determining its destiny. Further east, in the same
latitude as Crete, lies Cyprus, which we must now notice,
since its administration is in our hands, although it
seems a long way out of our direct course to the East.</p>

<p>The island lies far away from the Greek Archipelago,
in the angle formed by the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor,
where the Gulf of Antioch runs in between the Taurus
mountains of Cilicia and the northern continuation of
the coast range of Lebanon. It is a region rich in history.
On either side of the Gulf are the ancient sites
of Tarsus and Antioch; inland is the commercial city
of Aleppo, and beyond it the headwaters of the great
river Euphrates. This small corner of the Mediterranean,
now comparatively neglected, was of great
importance in the ancient world; and some knowledge
of its past may help us to appreciate its position at the
present day.</p>

<p>The origin of the first inhabitants of Cyprus is doubtful,
but we know that in historical times Phœnicians and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Greeks were settled here in large numbers. Kitium,
near the modern Larnaca, was Phœnician, while Salamis,
near Famagusta, was one of the chief centres of Greek
influence. These and many other cities, little kingdoms
in themselves, were well known to ancient historians;
though the whole island is only about twice the size of
Lancashire. Cyprus in early times became famous for
the worship of the Phœnician goddess Astarte, the Aphrodite <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
of the ancient Greeks. Here we can still see the
Phœnician rock tombs, and here are fragments of the <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 4</span>
marble columns which once supported a great temple
of Zeus. Perhaps, too, these vast heaps of slag, relics <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 5</span>
of the old workings for copper, which took its name
from the island, may be due in part to the people who
are thought to have reached even our own islands in
their search for tin. But for the most part, bombardments,
earthquakes, destructive natives and foreign
searchers after antiquities have left few remnants of
the ancient civilization except such as are buried beneath
the earth. The real interest of Cyprus for us lies rather
in its political history in mediæval and modern times.</p>

<p>In the ancient world it came under control of one
after another of the great Powers ruling the mainland:
Egypt, Phœnicia, Assyria, Media; though the control
was often nominal, being limited to the levying of tribute,
and the little native kingdoms maintained a partial
independence. Our own history has shown us the value
of a few miles of water as a protection from the great
military Powers of the neighbouring continent. As a
trading centre and naval base, on a coast where good
ports were few, Cyprus was of great value, and we are
not surprised to find that sea fights are frequent in its
history. The Romans annexed it from Egypt; at the
division of the Empire it was attached to Byzantium, and
though it was twice conquered by the Arabs it was twice
recovered. Here we see it already a bone of contention
between East and West. For a few months in the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
1191 Cyprus was even English territory. It was seized
by Richard I. on his way to the third Crusade, and in <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
the little town of Limassol which we see here, he was
married to Berengaria of Navarre by no less a personage
than the Archbishop of York. So we may claim that
our connexion with Cyprus is at least seven centuries
old. Richard sold his new possession to Guy de Lusignan,
a French Crusader, and thus Cyprus like Malta
came under the influence of Feudalism and the Latin
Church. Its external history, also, like that of Malta,
is made up for three centuries of fights and raids of Christian
against Mohammedan. Unlike Malta, it was fated
in the end to become part and parcel of the East. Towards
the end of the fourteenth century the Genoese
seized Famagusta, which they retained for many years;
and a century later the abdication of its last ruler, a
Venetian by birth, gave the whole island to the Republic
of Venice. Venice and Genoa were both naval and
trading Powers; the island was a good base both for
trade in the eastern Mediterranean and for warlike
operations against the Turk.</p>

<p>We can still see the lion of Venice and the old inscription <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
on the fortifications of the citadel of Famagusta, and
here too is a fragment of the ancient palace of the Lusignan <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
dynasty, which has escaped destruction by the
Turk only to be converted into a prosaic police station.
Unlike the knights of Malta, the Lusignans made little
impression on the natives of the island. They attempted
to replace the national Greek Church by the Latin;
yet the old Latin cathedral of St. Sophia is now used as
a mosque, while, in spite of occasional persecution, the
Greek Church still survives as the Church of the majority <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
of the people. Here is the outside of St. Sophia: it is
partly ruined, but we can see that it was once a fine building. <span class="linenum">10</span>
Inside, it still looks like a church, except for the
presence of Mohammedans wearing turbans. Out in
the country, near Nicosia, we come on a fine old monastery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> <span class="linenum">11</span>
still in the possession of the Greek Church. Notice
the monks in their curious dress. Not far away is a once-famous <span class="linenum">12</span>
abbey, now somewhat decayed, as we may judge
from a near view of the cloisters; here again is an ugly <span class="linenum">13</span>
modern village church, and here by way of contrast a
famous <em>tekkye</em>, or Mohammedan shrine. Everywhere <span class="linenum">14</span>
Turk and Cypriote, Mohammedan and Christian, are
side by side; and behind all is British power enforcing <span class="linenum">15</span>
law and order and compelling the different parties to
live at peace with one another.</p>

<p>Cyprus of to-day is what the Turks have made it, since
they conquered it from Venice in 1570; we have succeeded
to a heritage of mis-government, and the conditions
of our tenure hamper us greatly in the task of
bringing back prosperity to the people. In 1878, after
the treaty of San Stefano had been forced on Turkey
by Russia, we agreed to defend the Asiatic dominions
of the Sultan against further aggression, on condition
first that reforms were introduced for the protection of
his Christian subjects, and secondly that Cyprus should
be occupied and administered by Great Britain. We
added to the agreement an undertaking to pay annually
to the Porte the surplus revenue of the Island at the time
of the occupation, and to evacuate Cyprus if ever Russia
should restore Kars and her other Asiatic conquests to
Turkey. This undertaking has retarded the progress of
the island under our rule in the past, since this tribute,
which now goes to pay the interest on a Turkish loan,
represents a steady drain on the revenue, so that it has
been found necessary to make an annual grant-in-aid
from the British Treasury.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Cyprus.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Yet Cyprus is capable of great improvement. It was
famous in the ancient world for its beauty and fertility,
and at one time supported a much larger population
than at present. Let us get a general view with the <span class="linenum">16</span>
help of the map. A broad plain, the Messaoria, stretches
for seventy miles from one end of the island to the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
In the midst of it is Nicosia, the capital, and at the eastern
outlet is the port of Famagusta. On the north a narrow
mountain ridge separates the lowland from the sea. Here
is a view of Nicosia across the plain, with the mountain <span class="linenum">17</span>
ridges sheltering it on the north; and here is Famagusta
as it appears from the roof of St. Sophia. It hardly <span class="linenum">18</span>
strikes us as a busy seaport. On the south of the plain
a broader and more varied highland, rising to six thousand
feet in Mount Troodos, fills the whole corner of the <span class="linenum">19</span>
island. Here we see Troodos from the south. The slope
on our left is terraced for vineyards. Here is a closer view <span class="linenum">20</span>
of one of them. The southern slope of the mountain is
the home of the vine, for which Cyprus was famous in
antiquity, and all along its foot are the sites of ancient
cities. The plain is fertilized by the silt brought down
from the mountains by the heavy winter rains; but
in the spring and summer the rivers dry up and disappear
in the porous soil, and irrigation is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to retain the water for the growing crops. The inland
plain is not only dry but intensely hot in summer, as
the mountains cut off the cool breezes from the sea.
Even the natives cannot work in the noonday heat, and
we may often in our walks come on the harvesters taking <span class="linenum">21</span>
their noonday rest in the shade, as in the picture before
us. At one time the climate must have been more
equable, when the plain was heavily forested; even
to-day it could be much improved by replanting the
trees. The Government is undertaking the work, but
the people and the goats are most destructive, so forest <span class="linenum">22</span>
guards have to be employed, such as the two picturesque
figures who are posing here to our artist for their portraits.
Time and money, especially money, are needed to repair
centuries of neglect, and the natives will do nothing
without European control. Here the climate intervenes;
in spring and autumn it is not unpleasant for Europeans,
but in the summer months, as in India, they take
refuge in the hills, unless, as commonly happens, their
duties tie them to the plains.</p>

<p>The future of Cyprus depends on its agriculture. The
locusts, which at one time threatened to eat up everything,
have been almost exterminated by special methods of
trapping introduced by the Government; the real
trouble arises from the recurrence of drought and from
the backward condition of the native peasantry. Only
a small part of the land is under cultivation, and the
methods of the native are such as might be expected
after centuries of misgovernment and excessive taxation.
He scratches the surface of the soil with a primitive
plough, sows the seed broadcast, regardless of weeds,
and reaps the grain with sickles. The threshing is <span class="linenum">23</span>
equally primitive. Oxen drag about on the threshing
floor a board studded with flints, and the grain is then
winnowed by throwing it into the air with shovels
when the wind happens to be blowing. We can quite
understand that the wheat will not be of the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
quality after these operations. The methods of the
peasant are those followed by his ancestors thousands
of years ago, and he is slow to learn, though the
efforts of the Government to teach him are now showing
some good results.</p>

<p>To see the life of the real Cypriotes in its most primitive
form we must go to the villages and farms; here <span class="linenum">24</span>
we see one of these villages, with its orange orchards;
and here is a Turkish villager at the well. In the <span class="linenum">25</span>
coast towns we find another type, the Levantine Greek,
who meets us everywhere on the shores of the eastern
Mediterranean. He is a trader and shopkeeper&mdash;not a
cultivator of the soil. The true Cypriotes are not modern
Greeks, though they speak the Greek tongue and belong
to the Orthodox or Greek Church. There are also many
Turks settled in the island, but as the native Cypriotes
are rather more industrious as well as more numerous,
they are gradually regaining possession of the land, and
the Turkish influence is growing weaker. But Turks
and Cypriotes are alike in their backward methods and
reckless waste of the resources of the country. They
will cut down a whole tree for the sake of a single plank,
and destroy an ancient building to make a stable. In
the towns they have completed the work begun by the <span class="linenum">26</span>
great stone balls from the old Turkish cannon. Here
is one of these old huge weapons which was fished up
in Famagusta bay. It has an interesting history, since it
is said to have been given by Henry VIII. to the Knights
of St. John, to aid them in the recovery of Rhodes from the
Turk. Primitive though it looks, such a gun could do
a great deal of damage; and the builders completed what <span class="linenum">27</span>
the guns began. The ruins of ancient Salamis supplied
stones for old Famagusta; of Salamis nothing but a <span class="linenum">28</span>
waste remains. Old Famagusta in its turn was dismantled,
as we see it here, for the building of the new
modern town, while much of the material was even sent
by the Turks to Alexandria. It was easier to collect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the stones ready made than to dig them from the quarries.
We find fragments of ancient temples and monuments
built into walls and farmhouses; and it is necessary to
set a guard over some of the most interesting of the old
ruins, as over the forests, to preserve them from further
destruction, though the natives strongly resent this <span class="linenum">29</span>
interference with their usual habits. The Cypriotes
have little regard for their own past history and its <span class="linenum">30</span>
monuments. Here are some of the famous ruins of St.
Hilarion, with their guard: we can see how convenient the <span class="linenum">31</span>
native would find these ready-hewn stones for his building.</p>

<p>The importance of Cyprus in ancient and mediæval
times was due to its position, with its harbours and shipping,
between the great Powers to the north, east and
south. It commanded the sea-routes which they used
in their expeditions one against another. The old
harbours are small and silted up, or mere open roadsteads <span class="linenum">32</span>
quite unfitted for modern steamships, like the
famous Bay of Salamis which we see here. At Famagusta <span class="linenum">33</span>
we find a modern harbour, constructed by the
Government, and here too the one little railway of the
island starts for the interior and the capital. At one of <span class="linenum">34</span>
the stations a Levantine Greek brings us refreshments,
while close by we see two Turkish women, closely veiled
in <em>yashmaks</em>. Except at Famagusta we shall probably
anchor off shore, and if the sea is rough we may find some
difficulty in landing. Yet with the aid of really good
harbours Cyprus might once again become a collecting
centre for the trade of the neighbouring coasts, and so
regain some of its lost prosperity. Political conditions
have changed; the strong British garrison which formerly
occupied the island has been withdrawn; but in
the near future some of its past strategic importance <span class="linenum">35</span>
may return. The great railway, already in progress,
from the Bosporus to the Persian Gulf, must approach
the sea at one point only in its course, where it comes down
over the Taurus range beyond the head of the Gulf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Antioch. The railway, when completed, will provide a
route towards India roughly parallel to that through the
Suez Canal, and may lead to a revival of agriculture in the
rich valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris. The natural
approach to this route from the Mediterranean is not by
way of the Sea of Marmora but by the Gulf of Antioch,
and there will be a branch from the main line to Alexandretta
or some other port near. Cyprus will then
once again be on the line of a great trade route and must
have a share in its prosperity; at present it is side-tracked,
and has suffered like an English town avoided
by some great line of railway; its importance has declined
as that of Egypt has increased. We may realize
how far Cyprus is off the main line of traffic by the difficulty
of getting back to our route; as it may take us a
week to reach Egypt, travelling by slow steamer and
touching at ports on the Syrian coast on our way.</p>

<p>We are bound for the Suez Canal and are approaching
Port Said at last. The coast ahead looks flat and desolate:
on our right a long line of sand and mud banks
separates the shallow lake Menzaleh from the open sea;
on our left are more mud banks, and beyond them waste
marsh and desert. In front, for over a mile, two long
piers jut out through the brown water on the shallows;
very different it looks from the deep blue of the open
Mediterranean. The piers are needed to protect the
channel from the silt which is swept along the coast by
the currents; within them, on one of the mud banks,
stands the town of Port Said, modern, squalid and not
specially interesting. We are in the extreme corner of
the delta of the Nile, on the edge of the Arabian desert
and far away from Egypt proper, with its picturesque
life and people. Only commercial necessity could have
planted a town on such a site; it is the gateway to the
Canal and nothing more.</p>

<p>Our chief recollection of Port Said is likely to be <span class="linenum">36</span>
coal and coal dust. No sooner is the anchor down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
than barges are drawn by tugs up to the side of our
vessel. The barges are sunk to the water’s edge with
their load of coal, and on them stand crowds of men
in dark robes, natives of Africa of every race. Even
here, however, we are reminded of home, for the coal
has probably been brought all the way from Cardiff
and stored here for the supply of our mail boat and
others like it which do not carry enough coal for long
voyages at high speed. The barges are made fast to
the side; gangways are hoisted into place; and then
with much bustle and shouting the coal is shovelled into
baskets and carried into the steamer’s bunkers by continuous
streams of men. The black grit flies over everything,
and we may perhaps avoid it by landing for a
short glimpse of the town. We can stroll along the <span class="linenum">37</span>
front drive or up the main street and look at the bazaar
or stalls, where we may bargain for valueless curios; but
there is little to attract us here, and we shall be glad to
leave the grimy port and, passing the fine buildings of <span class="linenum">38</span>
the Canal offices, enter on our ninety-mile journey through
the great waterway.</p>

<p>We move slowly, about five miles an hour, with our
electric searchlight throwing its beam ahead if it is <span class="linenum">39</span>
night. Sometimes we meet a steamer coming north,
and must moor in one of the passing stations, as the
Canal is too narrow, except at these points, for large
vessels to pass one another. All round us is the desert,
though here and there we may see a small Arab village
or perhaps a string of slow-moving camels, where the
caravan route of the desert touches the line of the Canal.
Towards the southern end of the waterway we pass <span class="linenum">40</span>
through the Bitter Lakes. At some very remote age
there must have been a natural channel between the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea; of this the lakes are
fragments, partly dried up, and the builders of the Canal
have only repaired the original work of Nature. On
Lake Timsah, halfway across, stands the town of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Ismailiya. Here is the real connexion with Egypt, by
the railway from Cairo and the sweet water canal from
the Nile.</p>

<p>The sweet water canal represents in part the work of <span class="linenum">41</span>
various rulers of Egypt from the earliest recorded times.
The plan of connecting the two seas directly is modern;
it was natural that the earlier route should be by way
of the great river of Egypt and the inhabited part of
the country. The restoration and extension of this
ancient waterway was essential to the scheme for constructing
the Suez Canal. A good supply of water was
vitally necessary for the vast army of native labourers
engaged in the work; the Canal could also be used for
small traffic, and for reclaiming the neighbouring desert
by irrigation. So here we have a link with the real
Egypt, the waters of the Nile, and the great dam at <span class="linenum">42</span>
Assuan, far away up the river, which holds up the water
and controls the whole system. At both ends of this
long chain of water are vast engineering works of
the most modern type, designed by Europeans; between <span class="linenum">43</span>
are the Pyramids, the greatest triumphs of the
engineers and builders of the past, and the representatives
of Egypt with all its ancient civilization. It is
a strange contrast of the very old with the very new
which meets us in this corner of Africa: the present
conditions might have been very different if the great
route to India and the East had passed elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Suez Canal, though of vital importance to the
whole world and especially to the commercial Powers
of Europe, is not a national undertaking but private
property, constructed under a lease granted by the
Egyptian Government. Our own interests in it are
curious. The Canal was built through the energy and
initiative of the French; it is largely owned in France
and controlled from Paris. But the British people are
shareholders, since our Government, in 1875, bought up
the private shares of the Khedive, and now draws ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
commercial dividends which appear in our national
accounts. The shares originally cost us four millions
sterling. They are now returning us as profit over a
million every year. British ships, which are the largest
users of the Canal, contribute the greater part of these
dividends. But the waterway was too important to be
left as a mere private undertaking; so, in 1888, all the
great Powers of Europe agreed on a Convention to render
it free to the ships of all nations in time of peace or war.
By the terms of this agreement the Government of the
Khedive is entrusted with the task of enforcing neutrality
and protecting and maintaining the free use of the
Canal, with the assistance if necessary of the Government
of the Sultan of Turkey. In the last resort there
is an appeal to the Powers signing the Convention. The
Powers also agree to maintain the principle of equality
in the use of the Canal, and not to attempt to obtain any
special political or commercial privileges in regard to it.
Thus, so far as documents and safeguards can avail, the
Canal is to be maintained, in the interests of the whole of
Europe, as an open sea-road to the East.</p>

<p>We steam through the Bitter Lakes and finally reach <span class="linenum">44</span>
the southern end of the Canal. The town of Suez lies
away to the right, and beyond it the high coast of Egypt.
In the distance we can see the steamers at anchor and <span class="linenum">45</span>
the Egyptian bumboats plying busily to and fro. But
there is nothing to detain us here, so we steam on again
through the warm waters of the Red Sea. On either
side, for hundreds of miles, stretch the desert coasts of
Egypt and Arabia. On our right the sun seems to sink
behind a chain of mountains; these are not real mountains,
but only the edge of a plateau, for the land ends
in a steep brink overlooking the Red Sea, but slopes
gently westward to the valley of the Nile. Thus Egypt
proper belongs only to the river and turns its back on the
sea.</p>

<p>We have no ports of call on these desert coasts, so <span class="linenum">46</span>
make straight for the exit into the Gulf of Aden and the
wide Indian Ocean. As we near the southern end of the
Sea, the water grows shallower, its shores approach again,
and we can see bare brown rock on either hand, which
makes the blazing sun seem even hotter than before.
On our left, off a jutting corner of the Arabian coast,
lies a low bare island, Perim. It is without vegetation
or water, its sole virtue consisting in a deep harbour,
commanding the narrowest part of the outlet, where
the channel is only about twelve miles across. We
occupied it as a precaution, fifty years ago, and it is
now a coaling and cable station, with a small military
guard. But it is without fortifications, and in spite of
its position it is not the real key to the Red Sea; we
must look for this in Aden, a hundred miles further east,
just as we found in Gibraltar the control of the strait
to the westward.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Aden.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Aden proper is a small peninsula, five miles by three, <span class="linenum">47</span>
lying across a narrow isthmus which links it with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
mainland. Thus it is not unlike Gibraltar; but one end
of the peninsula, instead of jutting into the open sea,
stretches westward towards another peninsula, that of
Little Aden, which helps to enclose a large bay. Little
Aden, the coastline and the mainland for a short distance
inland were all obtained by purchase during the
latter part of the nineteenth century; and the whole
of the country behind, south of a line drawn northeastward
from the coast opposite Perim, is a British Sphere
of Influence. North of the line is the territory of Turkey.
Aden is thus made secure from hostile approach on the
land side. If we imagine the area of Gibraltar to be
extended all round the bay of Algeciras and inland to
the hill country of Spain, the position of the two fortresses
would closely correspond.</p>

<p>As we steam towards it, Aden appears as a rugged mass <span class="linenum">48</span>
of dark rock, ending in sharp edges and peaks. Along its
base runs a narrow strip of level ground, and a row of
mean-looking houses faces the bay and shows white
against a dark and bare background. There are no trees
or vegetation to relieve the gloomy monotony. Here we <span class="linenum">49</span>
are at anchor, well out, off Steamer Point, as much of the
inner bay is shallow. At once we are surrounded by <span class="linenum">50</span>
small boats manned by dark-skinned Somalis from Africa,
and bringing a mixed crowd of all races eager to sell us
tourists’ souvenirs, skins, horns and feathers, also the
product of Africa. Here too are more coaling barges as
at Port Said. We land and find that the near view is
hardly more attractive than the distant; but this is only
an outlying suburb of the real Aden. Let us hire a
carriage, as it is far too hot and dusty to walk. Our
driver is a Somali, and the animal in the shafts a decayed-looking
pony; while the vehicle itself threatens every <span class="linenum">51</span>
moment to collapse and leave us in the sandy road. We
make our way along the Akaba and through the narrow <span class="linenum">52</span>
and rocky Main Pass to the old city. We have passed
in our drive through the wall of an old crater and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
town lies at the bottom, surrounded on all sides by the
broken rim whose jagged edges we noticed from the sea. <span class="linenum">53</span>
Here is a general view of Aden from the heights above.
The whole peninsula is merely the fragment of an extinct
volcano. In the white town, with its straight streets,
we meet Arabs, Somalis, Indians, Negroes, Greeks, Jews
and British soldiers; their presence here, on a barren
rock between the desert and the sea, can be understood
only in the light of the past history of Aden.</p>

<p>Here, from the remotest antiquity, was without doubt
a great port of exchange for the products of India, Arabia,
Africa and the Mediterranean, by way of Egypt and the
Nile. In the Middle Ages, when first we hear of it from
travellers, Aden was still a strong and important city.
The Portuguese, after their discovery of the Cape route
to India, saw that the possession of Aden would complete
their control of the Indian Ocean; but they failed in their
efforts to capture it by open attack. The Turks held it
for a time as part of the Yemen, the neighbouring southwest
corner of Arabia; then it fell under the rule of various
local chiefs or Sultans. So we found it in 1838, when
we proposed to buy it from the reigning Sultan. The
negotiations failed through treachery and outrages on the
part of the natives; so in the following year an expedition
from India took forcible possession. As a result of
this, Aden is still technically a part of the Presidency of
Bombay.</p>

<p>Aden has been occupied continuously for thousands
of years, in spite of the fact that it has nothing whatever
to recommend it except a harbour and a fine commercial
and strategic position. The heat is intense; there is no
food produced on the spot for man or beast, and very
little water. In some years there is no rain at all; in
others a few showers come from the Indian Ocean, with
the Southwest Monsoon. The rain falls on the bare rock
and runs swiftly away; the lower courses of the streams
become rushing torrents for a few hours and then all is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
parched and dry again. More than a thousand years
ago the Persians, who then ruled the city, built a series
of huge tanks or reservoirs, often hewn out of the solid
rock, to catch the flood-water. We can judge from their
size and number that these tanks must have been built <span class="linenum">54</span>
to supply a large population. In course of time the tanks
were allowed to fall into decay, but some, as we see here, <span class="linenum">55</span>
have been restored under British rule; and since the
occupation of the district further inland, water has also
been brought by aqueduct from the wells at the village of
Sheik Othman. Sheik Othman is on the edge of the hills
and far more healthy and pleasant than Aden. Here is <span class="linenum">56</span>
one of the wells with a camel drawing water, and here we
have a typical scene in the village. The trees suggest at <span class="linenum">57</span>
once that the climate is different from that of Aden, and
this part of the country is likely to be used more and more
as a health resort for the troops of the garrison. In
building the aqueduct we merely followed the example of
earlier rulers, as the ruins of a similar aqueduct, centuries
old, are still to be seen. The aqueduct is not enough;
water is also brought in skins laden on the backs of camels,
and is manufactured in condensers. In fact, water is
perhaps the most rare and valuable commodity to be
found in Aden. All food, too, must be imported; and
here we must look not only to the back country of the
Yemen, but across the sea to the neighbouring coast of
Africa. Though some supplies are brought in by caravan
from the country round, yet Aden could not exist without
the regular shipments from Berbera and Zeila on the coast
of Somaliland. There is also considerable traffic in coffee,
ivory, feathers and skins from this coast, while native
Somalis swarm in Aden. So that Aden, by the necessities
of its existence, is closely linked with the neighbouring
Horn of Africa. With no products of its own,
it is a collecting centre for the trade of the coasts of Arabia
and the Persian Gulf; while caravans can come in comparative
safety from the Yemen country now that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
British Sphere of Influence has been extended inland to
the line drawn from Perim northeastward. The camel
caravan is one of the ordinary sights of the town, and <span class="linenum">58</span>
here in the native quarter we see the market for camels,
just as our English towns have their markets for horses
and cattle. Many of the camels are shipped across to <span class="linenum">59</span>
Somaliland, where we shall follow them later; and it is
interesting to see them hauled up in slings from barges
to the steamer’s deck. The camels, however, do not seem
to enjoy the experience.</p>

<p>Aden has had three stages in its history: first, a period
of prosperity, in the earliest days of trade between the
peoples of the Mediterranean and the East; then a period
of partial decay, when the centres of trade were shifted
to Western Europe and ships sailed round Africa to India
and the East; finally, a revival of its former position as
a commercial port of call on the restored Egyptian route,
and in addition an ever-growing importance as a coaling
point and centre of strategic control for the Indian Ocean.
The population is increasing, like that of Gibraltar, beyond
the capacity of the little peninsula; this has rendered
necessary the expansion of territory inland. Even
some of the troops of the garrison are now quartered
beyond the isthmus. But expansion of area does not
bring a corresponding growth in the supply of food for
the cosmopolitan population. A prosperous Aden must
in the future depend more and more on imported supplies,
and this must involve still closer relations with the nearest
source of supplies, the neighbouring coast of Africa.</p>

<p>The resources of Somaliland are not unlimited; while not
Aden alone, but the whole Red Sea coast of Arabia is
likely in the future to become more dependent on imported
food. Let us look back for a moment at these shores, <span class="linenum">(46)</span>
before we leave the Red Sea for the open ocean. We
remember that our mail steamer in its voyage found no
port of call between Suez and Aden. So we drive along
one of our own high roads to-day, with nothing to stop us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
through open fields and uninhabited country; yet a few
years hence we may find it lined with houses and shops,
and with branch roads pouring their traffic into the main
stream. It is possible that our sea-road may grow in the
same way. Along the eastern shore the Turks are building
a railway from Damascus to the sacred cities of Medina
and Mecca; it has already reached Medina, and at sometime
doubtless it will be continued southward to Hodeida
and the towns of the Yemen. For pilgrims, the railway will
make easier the journey to Mecca which every good Mohammedan
strives to take once in his life. For the Government
of Turkey it has another use: it will strengthen
their control over the southern corner of Arabia, a control
which is never too secure. The result must be more
people and more trade on the coast strip of Arabia, and
need for supplies of food greater than the neighbouring
country can produce. We may see here in the future the
problem of Aden on a large scale, and again we must look
across the sea.</p>

<p>Jeddah is the port of Mecca; almost opposite Jeddah,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'or the African'">on the African</ins> coast, is Port Sudan, the gate of the Anglo-Egyptian
Sudan, and the terminus of the Sudan Government
railway system, which crosses the desert to the Nile
and opens up the country from Wadi Haifa in the north to
Sennar in the southeast and El Obeid in the west. This
great region, with its centre at Khartum, is entirely dependent
for the bulk of its trade on the railway and the seaport.
As this country develops, it may find a market for part of
its products on the coast of Arabia, while the rest will join
the main movement through the Canal to Europe. That
portion of our high road which runs through the Mediterranean
owes much of its importance to the active life of the
neighbouring coasts; the Red Sea, by contrast, is a mere
passage through the desert which separates Europe from
Asia. But the railway is conquering the desert, and in the
future this portion also of the chain between West and
East will take some share in the busy traffic of the whole.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE INDIAN OCEAN</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">We leave Aden, with a mixed cargo of camels and Somalis,
and steam southward for a hundred and fifty miles across
the Gulf to visit the Horn of Africa, a region less known
to Europeans, before the present century, than much of
the distant interior of the vast Continent. We land <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</span>
at Berbera on the flat coast: behind the little pier are
the white houses of the European town, and in the background
a long mountain range. Lying off shore at <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2</span>
anchor is a vessel which attracts our attention at once,
as it reminds us of England; it is a sailing ship of the
old type, far more graceful than our steamer, resembling
the hulks which may be seen moored in some of our
ports, with their sailing days long past. But here it is
still in full use; it has lost its English name and become
the Shah Jehan, and trades under the Persian flag,
bringing dates once a year from Muscat on the Gulf of
Oman. The seasonal visit of this ancient ship may
serve to remind us that we are merely newcomers in
this quarter of the world, and that it had its own busy
life long before our arrival or the age of steamships.</p>

<p>In Berbera we find the Somali in his natural state. <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
The native town is a mere collection of primitive huts,
made of mats, rags, mud and sticks; it looks like an
encampment rather than a town; but we must not be
too ready to judge the native by his house, as we shall
see later that he has a good reason for not building a
more permanent home.</p>

<p>Somaliland is rather larger than England and Wales
together, yet a short excursion inland to the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
will tell us nearly all that we want to know about the
country and its inhabitants. Our way lies southward,
across a desolate, stony plain, studded with dry thorn
bushes; it does not seem an inviting country. The
plain is narrow here, but further west towards Zeila it
broadens out to over fifty miles. A few miles out, where
we touch the foothills, we may be surprised to find
springs of warm water, issuing from the limestone rock.
On these Berbera depends for its existence, as there is
no rainfall on the plain worth considering. Here we
see one of these springs and here is the reservoir. Leaving <span class="linenum">4,5</span>
the plain we mount a steep slope and come out on a
plateau; it is even more bare and stony than the plain <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
below. In front our track leads towards a long ridge,
five thousand feet high, the Gorlis Mountains; on our
left is the still higher range of Wagga. We cross the
plateau and climb up the pass to Sheikh; here we see <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
our path by a rocky torrent bed. We must carry
with us our own camp, as we shall find little shelter
in this wild country and few inhabitants; though
when we have pitched our tent for the night, we <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
have a visit from a native, armed with spear and shield,
and curious to make the acquaintance of the white intruder.
We notice that he seems very suspicious of the
camera. At Sheikh we are in the heart of the mountains. <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
From the bungalow of the political officer we have a
fine view down the long, steep pass, and can form some
idea of the nature of the rugged country through which <span class="linenum">10</span>
we are travelling. Here is another view across the mountain
ridges.</p>

<p>To reach the highest view-point we must ride eastward
to Wagga, across another part of the plateau, dry and
desolate as before. Dotted here and there are gigantic
red pillars; these strange-looking shapes are not rocks <span class="linenum">11</span>
but ant hills; they are sometimes large enough to give
us a little shade from the burning sun of the desert. We
can judge the size of the hill before us by comparison with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> <span class="linenum">12</span>
our camel escort; and here is a closer view of another
to help us. Far away in the background we can distinguish <span class="linenum">13</span>
the Wagga Mountains. The stony slopes of Wagga
are less bare than the plateau, though the vegetation
again is mostly thorns and aloes, with here and there a
few cedars. After a long scramble we reach the summit, <span class="linenum">14</span>
up among the clouds, six thousand feet above the level
of the sea. Here are two views from the summit, one <span class="linenum">15</span>
towards the east, the other towards the west; and here
is our native guide, Giringh by name, pointing northwards <span class="linenum">16</span>
to where, over forty miles away, we can just catch a
glimpse of the Gulf of Aden.</p>

<p>Let us try to realize where we are standing. If we <span class="linenum">17</span>
travel southward from Wagga or from Sheikh, we go
downhill, but we find that the dried-up beds of the
streams are sloping away from the sea. We have crossed
the main water-parting of the country. The mountain
ridges which we have scaled are merely the steep broken
edges of a great highland block which falls gently southwards
to a broad plateau, without hills or streams, a
monotony of stones, red earth, dust and dense thorn scrub.
In the dry season we may travel for a week or ten days
together and find not a drop of water. On the caravan <span class="linenum">18</span>
routes are a few wells, such as we see here, but many of
these dry up, and we have to dig for a few mouthfuls
of warm, dirty water in the liquid mud at the bottom.
This is the <em>Haud</em>; it belongs partly to Britain, partly
to Italy and partly to Abyssinia, though in such a
country boundaries have little or no meaning; they
are merely imaginary lines drawn from a few known
points through the unexplored area.</p>

<p>On the mountain slopes and on the plains at the foot
are the courses of many rivers and streams. These
are marked on the map, but few are permanent. In the
rains they are rushing torrents, overflowing the channels
which are too narrow to contain them and spreading
out into wide unhealthy marshes; in the dry season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
they are mere channels or <em>tugs</em>, with a few stagnant pools
in the deepest parts. The rains are of the tropical kind,
beginning in April and going on, with one break, through
the summer. The winter months are almost rainless,
and the smallest annual fall is on the coast.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of the plateau and the seasonal rainfall
have been largely responsible for the shaping of the
Somali. He is essentially a nomad; all his property
is moveable and consists of flocks and herds and camels.
It is true that there are remains of stone buildings, and
deep wells in the rock, especially further inland; but
these are not the work of the present-day Somali; his
house is as easily moved as his cattle. In the dry weather <span class="linenum">19</span>
we see the herds collected round the permanent wells
and on the banks of the few streams where some water
and pasture are still to be found. Notice the primitive <span class="linenum">20</span>
native method of getting at the water. A man is handing
it up in a jar or skin, while another pours it into a trough
for the cattle. The summer rains bring vegetation to
the dry steppe, and forthwith the people with their
animals migrate to the cooler air and fresh pasture of
the plateau. Berbera and the coast towns empty
themselves in this way in the hot weather, so that there
is a great change in the size of the population at different
seasons of the year. There is no real agriculture until
we reach the borders of Abyssinia and the river valleys
in the far south and west.</p>

<p>We can now appreciate the importance of the camel
in the life of the Somali. Further inland, towards Harrar,
where there is more pasture, the mule is to be found;
but for the dry region of the <em>Haud</em> the camel is the only
efficient beast of burden. Here we have him carrying <span class="linenum">21</span>
all the goods of his owner, fastened not to a saddle but
to mats strapped round him. He appears to enjoy
feeding on thorns and will travel for days together without
water. He is also looked on as a great delicacy to
be eaten by those who can afford it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The natives of Somaliland are very different in race
from the African people who live further south. Here <span class="linenum">22</span>
is a group of men, posed for the camera, with their
little round shields and long, broad-bladed spears; <span class="linenum">23</span>
and here are some mounted warriors. The Somali
is a born fighter, and his weapons are never very
far away from him. The Somalis are an old Hamitic
people, akin to the early inhabitants of Egypt and the
races of the Mediterranean coasts of Africa. There is
also a later admixture of Arab blood, due to the nearness
of Arabia and the spread of Arab power in the Middle
Ages all along the eastern coast of Africa. They themselves
claim Arab descent and show much of the love of
independence which is found among the Arabs. In
religion, too, they are fanatical Mohammedans, and they
have never really been conquered by an invader from
without. For a few years the Government of Egypt
occupied the coast towns and some posts in the interior
in the neighbourhood of Harrar. When the Egyptians
retired, in 1884, we at once occupied part of the coast
as a dependency of Aden. About the same time the
French took the corner opposite Perim, while a long
strip of coast on either side fell to Italy. Behind all these
is the independent native kingdom of Abyssinia. For
a time British Somaliland was governed as a part of
Aden; there was good reason for this since the country
is of small value except in relation to the control of the
Red Sea route, and is also entirely cut off on the land
side from the rest of our African territory. It is now
under the Colonial Office and is administered by a Commissioner,
like so many of our smaller Crown Colonies
and Protectorates.</p>

<p>To keep order in the coast towns there is a force of
native Civil Police, under a European officer: here are <span class="linenum">24</span>
some of the havildars, and here the whole body in review
order; but we see that, unlike our own police, they are <span class="linenum">25</span>
armed with rifles. Somaliland is not a peaceful country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and police alone are not enough; so a military force is
necessary. This consisted formerly of a battalion of
the King’s African Rifles, recruited partly from the
natives and partly from India. Here are the drummers <span class="linenum">26</span>
and buglers, all natives, with a native officer; and here
is a whole company of Rifles on parade. They are <span class="linenum">27</span>
mounted on mules, and the European officer alone is
on horseback. This native force has been disbanded
and replaced by a contingent of Indian troops. We
have also, in the past, been compelled to employ
British and Indian troops for expeditions up country,
to deal with the followers of a Mohammedan Mullah
who proclaimed a <em>jihad</em>, or holy war, a few years
ago, and raided first the Christians of Abyssinia and
then the natives in our own territory. The Mullah
was only copying on a larger scale the usual methods of
the tribes of the interior; since the chief amusement
of the Somali consists in annexing the property of his
neighbours, whenever and wherever he can find the
opportunity. The geography of the country is all in
favour of the native raider and against the civilized
troops which attempt to catch him. In the dry season,
when the Somali is for a time a fixture in the neighbourhood
of the wells, it is almost impossible to move a considerable
force up country, owing to the want of food and
water for men and animals on the march. When the
rains come, the whole country is open for the game of
hide-and-seek, and in this the white man is no match
for the quick-moving native, who is troubled by no
problem of transport and is a nomad born and bred.
The land itself fights for the Somali; so that effective
European control is limited to the coast, except where
the French have pushed inland with the railway from
Jibouti to the neighbourhood of Harrar. None the
less, the occupation of the coast towns, Berbera, Bulhar
and Zeila, is not entirely useless, since these are the
ends of the caravan routes from Abyssinia and the interior.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Here the animals, skins, gums and other wild
products of the country are exchanged for the rice of
India, the dates of Arabia, and the cottons of Europe
and America which form the sole dress of the native.
For the rest, the Somali is likely to be left in the undisturbed
enjoyment of his native customs; his chief visitor
will be the sportsman and the naturalist, as the land
abounds in wild game and is the home of many strange
plants and animals which are not to be met with elsewhere
in Africa.</p>

<p>We have made a brief survey of British Somaliland,
and though much is not yet explored, yet it is not likely
to differ greatly from the part which we have seen.
There will be the same red dust and monotonous stony
plain with its thorn bushes and dry stream-beds. In
some parts, by way of variety, the thorn will grow so
dense as to be impenetrable; in others it will disappear,
and we shall find pure desert. Only a Somali or a camel
could live and thrive in such a country. So we return to
the coast and continue our voyage. Again we must <span class="linenum">28</span>
turn aside from the direct road across the ocean to India
and follow for a time the long coast of Africa. We round
Cape Guardafui, now the extreme tip of the Horn; but
the sea here is shallow, and the islands which continue
the line of the headland must at some remote time have
been joined to the continent. Of these islands, Socotra,
long and narrow, about a hundred miles from end to
end, alone need be noticed. It is a British Protectorate,
controlled from Aden, though nominally dependent on
the little Arabian state of Kishin. It is without harbours
or trade, and our only interest there is to prevent its
occupation by any other Power which might dispute
with us the control of the Red Sea entrance. Aden,
Somaliland, Perim and Socotra have all the same place
in our policy; they have no meaning except in relation
to the control of the sea.</p>

<p>We steam onwards, and across the Equator, passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
by the coastline of Italian Somaliland and British East
Africa, to where, nearly two thousand miles from Aden,
and close in to the mainland, are two other islands
coloured red on the map, Pemba and Zanzibar. We are
a long way off our course to India, yet Zanzibar and
the narrow strip of coast behind it belong by history
and development to India and Arabia rather than to the
neighbouring continent.</p>

<p>The Portuguese, on the way to India, creeping along
the coast in their old-fashioned vessels, found here Arab
traders and Arab cities with an active intercourse across
the Indian Ocean. The periodic Monsoon winds brought
the fleets of dhows, with the produce of India and the
Persian Gulf, and carried them back with their cargoes
of ivory and slaves. The Portuguese occupied the
African coast region as part of their Indian Empire;
the English and Dutch, at a later time, made straight
across the ocean from the Cape or Mauritius and left
the Portuguese undisturbed. So, when the rule of
Portugal collapsed through its own weakness, the old
conditions were restored.</p>

<p>For a long time Zanzibar and the neighbouring coasts
were ruled by local chiefs, nominally dependent on the
Iman of Muscat in southeastern Arabia; until, early
in the nineteenth century, Seyyid Said transferred his
court from Muscat to Zanzibar and extended his power
over all the neighbouring coast. On his death, in the
middle of the century, Zanzibar, largely through the
influence of the Viceroy of India, was separated politically
from Muscat. It remains to-day in name an independent
kingdom, though stripped of its dominions on
the mainland and under the Protection of Britain. We
became concerned with this region, in the nineteenth
century, mainly owing to our efforts to suppress the
slave trade of which it was the chief centre. We found
it impossible to carry out our policy without some effective
control over the native states, and our paramount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
interests in Zanzibar and the mainland to the north have
been recognized in our agreements with France and <span class="linenum">29</span>
Germany. To-day the palace of the Sultan still remains,
but on the site of the old slave-market stands the Cathedral <span class="linenum">30</span>
as a sign of the success of our efforts.</p>

<p>The island of Zanzibar is long and narrow; it measures
about fifty miles from north to south, and only twenty-five
at its widest in the middle. It is nearly three times
the size of the Isle of Man. A long ridge of hills divides
it into two distinct parts. The east is largely made
up of old coral rock, with a very thin layer of soil; it
is not very fertile and is, moreover, exposed to the full
force of the Trade winds. Most of the population is on
the more sheltered western side, and here are the town
and harbour of Zanzibar. The ruling class and original
landowners are Arabs; but the mass of the people are
Swahili, of mixed African and Asiatic descent, and freed <span class="linenum">31</span>
slaves, largely natives of Africa. Here is a typical group
of natives. The chief wealth of the island lies in the
cultivation of cloves, as a large portion of the world’s
crop is grown here; but there are also the coconut palm,
the rubber vine and many other tropical plants. A
great and interesting change is taking place in the ownership
of the plantations: the natives of India, shopkeepers,
traders and moneylenders, are steadily ousting
the Arabs. The Arab has lost much of his wealth, through
the emancipation of his slaves, and is slow to adapt himself
to the new conditions; so that the thrifty Indian bids
fair to annex the whole island in the near future, and
Zanzibar will renew its connexion with the mainland
on the other side of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Apart from its agriculture, the chief value of the island is
in the sheltered roadstead of the capital, as good harbours <span class="linenum">32</span>
are rare in this part of the world. Here we see it from the
sea, and here is one of the main streets of the town. In <span class="linenum">33</span>
Zanzibar we find all the races of the Indian Ocean represented,
and here are collected all the products of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
islands and of the coast of Africa, which is only twenty-five
miles away. The trade with India still remains,
while the steamship has brought also direct intercourse
with Europe. In the early days of trade, the security
of a position on an island was an important factor in
the growth of a seaport; now that Europe is policing
both the sea and the mainland, the advantage of the
island is less, and Zanzibar has a growing rival a hundred
and fifty miles away on the coast of Africa. Mombasa <span class="linenum">34</span>
is on a small island, connected with the mainland by a
causeway. On the north side is Mombasa harbour, <span class="linenum">35</span>
rather shallow and not very convenient for shipping; on
the south is the deep Kilindini channel, running for a long
distance inland and providing one of the finest harbours
on the east coast of Africa. Mombasa is the terminus
of the railway which crosses the low coast strip and surmounts
the plateau of East Africa. The trade of the
port is very old; but only slaves and ivory could be
carried in former times over the long and difficult
caravan route which ended here. Now, the railway
can bring down to the sea all the products of a vast <span class="linenum">36</span>
area inland. Here we have a scene on the old road,
and here by way of contrast the modern railway. <span class="linenum">37</span>
Mombasa, like Port Sudan, will create a new traffic in
the future, to join the great stream which moves through
the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal; but the subject
of British East Africa and its resources must be left
for future treatment; here we are concerned only with
its relation to our sea route.</p>

</div>

<p>Before we turn towards India we have yet another
island to visit, an island connected not with the new,
but with the old route to the East. This is Mauritius,
lying east of Madagascar and well out in the Indian
Ocean, about two thousand four hundred miles from
Aden and rather less from Ceylon. We shall find it
very different from Zanzibar. A French patois is the
language commonly spoken; most of the names on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
map are French, and the statue of a great Frenchman <span class="linenum">38</span>
is one of the first things which we notice on landing at
Port Louis. Mauritius was in effect a purely French
colony, when it became ours by conquest just a century
ago; but the immigration from India is now modifying
rapidly the French character of the island.</p>

<p>Before the French were the Dutch: they settled
first in the southeast corner, as Grand Port was the last
convenient point of call on the way from the Cape to
Ceylon, before the long voyage across the open ocean.
After a century of partial occupation, the Dutch retired
in 1712, leaving behind them the name Mauritius, taken
from that of Count Maurice of Nassau, the Stadtholder
of Holland. The French, who were already in Madagascar
and the neighbouring island of Bourbon, promptly
occupied Mauritius, re-naming it <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Île de France</span>. It was
controlled by the French East-India Company and
became in a few years very prosperous under the administration
of Mahé de Labourdonnais. His name
still survives in Mahébourg, and we have already seen
his statue in Port Louis. During our war with France
at the end of the century, Mauritius, owing to its position
on the only route to India, was used as a base for attacking
our commerce by the French privateers who swarmed
in these seas; so that its capture became necessary for
the security of our Indian possessions. Both Bourbon
and Mauritius were taken, but the former was restored
to France by the peace of 1814.</p>

<p>The island as we found it was a true French plantation-colony.
The ruling classes were the Creole landowners,
French by descent; while the actual work of the plantations
was carried on by slaves imported from Africa.
It is still thoroughly French, and the plantation system
survives in a modified form as the sole support of the
people; but the former importance of the island as a
commercial and strategic centre has greatly declined
with the opening of the Suez Canal. Mauritius is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
longer on a great trade route, but it is well worth a visit
in itself and is still closely connected with our final
destination, India.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i066.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Mauritius.</span></div>
</div>

<p>We must first make a brief survey with the map. The <span class="linenum">39</span>
island is in the form of a rough oval, a little over thirty
miles long, less than half the size of the county of Kent.
Its coasts are fringed with coral reefs, broken here and
there by gaps, especially where the streams of fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
water enter the sea. Behind these gaps are the seaports,
of which only two are of any size, Grand Port or Mahébourg
at the southeast corner, and Port Louis, the capital,
in the northwest. Grand Port was occupied first, but <span class="linenum">40</span>
it is open to the Southeast Trades; so that Port Louis,
like Zanzibar, on the sheltered side, and with a good
harbour, has become the chief port for the whole island.
In the north and part of the east and the southeast
corner the land lies fairly low; here we find the chief
towns, the plantations and most of the population. A
great deal of the centre and south is filled up with hills
and plateaux; some of the peaks rising to over two <span class="linenum">41</span>
thousand feet. Here are the Moka Mountains, behind
Port Louis, steep and rugged, crowned by a strange
peak, Pieterboth Head, which is a useful landmark for <span class="linenum">42</span>
sailors. Notice the Dutch name. In the southwest
the hills are very near to the sea; the coast plain is
narrow, the slopes are steep and the rivers come down
in rapids and falls amidst wild and beautiful scenery. <span class="linenum">43</span>
Here is the Chamarel fall and here again are the falls on
the Savanne River. The railways are a fair guide to <span class="linenum">44</span>
the structure of the country, as they keep for the
most part to the lowland or the river valleys, except
where the main line from Port Louis to Mahébourg is
forced to surmount the middle of the plateau; while
the Moka branch crosses a steep ridge on its way to the
lower country to the east. Here we see one of the curious <span class="linenum">45</span>
trains crossing one of the mountain streams at the foot
of the bare hill slopes; the picture gives a good idea of
the scenery on the railway.</p>

<p>The rainfall in Mauritius is heavy in the summer
months, December to March, especially on the east side
of the hills, where the wind comes straight in from the
warm ocean; and the temperature is high, at sea level,
as Mauritius lies on the edge of the Tropics. Heat
and rain, together with a rich volcanic soil, have made
Mauritius what it is to-day. Agriculture is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
occupation of the people, and the only important crop
is the sugar-cane. This was first introduced from the
East India Islands by the Dutch, though little progress
was made with its cultivation until the time of the French
settlement. The forest which then covered the island
was cleared away, and the cultivation of the cane, by
means of slave labour on large plantations, became
the staple industry of the new colonists. Large fortunes
were made in the early part of the nineteenth century,
but Mauritius, like the West Indies, has suffered greatly
from the competition of beet-sugar, and its trade has
declined greatly, though it has still a good market in
India. Too much dependence on a single product has
brought ruin on many of the planters. Here is a picture <span class="linenum">46</span>
of one of these large sugar estates. In front of us we
see the cane growing and the planter looking over his
crops; the ugly building, with the chimney, which
spoils the middle of the picture, is the mill where the
cane is crushed to extract the juice.</p>

<p>The cultivation of sugar in Mauritius, like that of tea
in Ceylon, has produced remarkable changes in the
character of the people. When slavery was abolished,
in 1835, new sources of labour for the plantations had to
be found, and Indian coolies were imported on a large
scale. These usually remained when the term of their
contract was over; with the result that at the present
time about three-quarters of the total population of
the island is of Indian descent, the majority having
been born in the island. We find them everywhere in <span class="linenum">47</span>
the island, living contentedly in primitive huts and
cultivating their small patches of land. They are steadily
acquiring the land in small plots and manage to exist
comfortably even under present conditions. In short,
Mauritius is becoming more and more an offshoot of
India, since not only the labour but much of the food
supply must come from the rice fields of India, so long
as nearly all the land under cultivation is given up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a single crop like sugar. The climate, too, is more suitable
to the brown than to the white people; malarial fever
is always present, and the general conditions have not
been improved by the cutting down of the greater part
of the forest. Sometimes the weather brings disaster
in a swift and sudden form, as Mauritius lies in the track
of the cyclones which whirl in from the northeast, especially
in March and April, and travel southwards towards
Madagascar. In a few hours one of these terrible storms
can destroy houses and plantations and undo the work
of years. One of the worst of these, in recent years,
struck the island in 1892; and here we see some of the <span class="linenum">48</span>
damage done at Port Louis. The planter in this beautiful
island has truly many difficulties to contend with. It
is possible that the growth of trade in Madagascar and
on the neighbouring coasts of Africa may bring back a
little of its past prosperity to Port Louis; but Mauritius
can never regain the position which it enjoyed before
the piercing of the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>If we look at the map showing the depths of the Indian <span class="linenum">(28)</span>
Ocean, we notice that Mauritius, with the sister French
island of Réunion, rests on a relatively shallow bank,
raised above the ocean floor. Following this bank
northwards for nearly a thousand miles, we come to a
whole group of little islands which are connected by a
similar bank with Madagascar. The most northerly
of this group are the Seychelles. Another great bank
runs southward from India with scores of islets on it.
In the north are the Laccadives, close to the coast of
India; in the middle are the Maldives; and in the far
south, beyond the Equator, right out in the ocean, is the
little Chagos Archipelago, including the coral island of
Diego Garcia, where at one time there was a small coaling
station used by vessels bound to Australia. All these
islands are but the fragments of a sunken land-mass
which at a very early period of the worlds history joined
South Africa to India. They are widely separated if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
we look only at the surface of the sea, but really joined
together if we look below.</p>

<p>Mahé, the largest of the Seychelles, has an area of
rather over fifty square miles, a little more than that of
the island of Jersey; we could walk from end to end
of it in a few hours. A map, showing Zanzibar, Pemba, <span class="linenum">49</span>
Mauritius and the Seychelles on the same scale, may
perhaps help us to realize their relative size and shape.
There is one good harbour in Mahé, on which stands
Victoria, the capital, where steamers sometimes call on
the voyage from Aden to Mauritius or from India to <span class="linenum">50</span>
Mombasa. Here is a general view of the harbour and
here is a street in the little town. The whole group was <span class="linenum">51</span>
dependent on Mauritius and was given up to us at
the same time as that island. The language of the
people is still modified French. The Seychelles are
fertile and beautiful and not unhealthy, in spite of
their nearness to the Equator. They naturally abound
in tropical plants, among which the coconut palm is the
most valuable to the natives. Here are some of <span class="linenum">52</span>
these palms with the mill where the oil is extracted
from the nut. Here also we see a species of fan palm, <span class="linenum">53</span>
which has a strange history. Centuries ago, the Portuguese
found washed up in the Maldives and on the southwest
coasts of India a curious double nut, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coco-de-mer</i>. <span class="linenum">54</span>
The tree which produced the nut was unknown
and could not be discovered in the neighbouring islands,
so the fable was invented that it grew in the depths of
the sea. The nut was much valued in India as a medicine,
but in spite of careful search not until the end of the
eighteenth century was the parent tree found in the
Seychelles, where alone it grows. The Southwest Monsoon,
blowing for months at a time, carried the nut all
the way to India, just as it brought the fleets of Arab
dhows from the coast of Africa. So we have in this
tale of the nut a useful reminder of the climate of the
Indian Ocean. We will now leave the Seychelles after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a glance at another strange product of a neighbouring <span class="linenum">55</span>
island, Aldabra. This is the giant tortoise. It was at
one time very common in this part of the Indian Ocean,
as we learn from the accounts of early voyagers, but it
is now rare.</p>

<p>Mauritius and the Seychelles, with many of the smaller
groups and islands in the Indian Ocean, came into our
hands in connexion with the development of the old
route to India by way of the Cape. There is one group,
among the nearest to India, which through all the changes
of Portuguese, Dutch and British occupation has succeeded
in maintaining a partial independence. The
northernmost of the Maldive islands are only about
four hundred miles from the coast of Ceylon, within
easy reach not only of the road from Africa and the Seychelles
to India, but also of the more important road
from Arabia, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to the
Malay Archipelago and the Far East. The language
of the people, as we might expect from the near neighbourhood
of Ceylon, is closely akin to old-fashioned
Sinhalese. We may perhaps regard the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'peop e as colonists'">people as colonists</ins>
from Ceylon, with a large mixed element due to the
Arab traders who must have visited the islands often in
their voyages. The Maldives have always followed the
fortunes of Ceylon; they have recognized in turn Portuguese,
Dutch and British authority, but have succeeded
in avoiding complete annexation. This may be due
partly to the fact that there is little in them to attract
invaders. The islands which make up the group are
mere coral atolls, with no good harbours, a very small
supply of good water, and few products for trade. The <span class="linenum">56</span>
Maldive trading fleet, which we see here, does not suggest
a very heavy traffic. What there is, mostly dried fish,
finds its only market in Ceylon, which sends, among <span class="linenum">57</span>
other things, fresh drinking water in return. The Sultan
is on good terms with our officials: here we see him, <span class="linenum">58</span>
with his suite, visiting a British warship, and here he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
is receiving the return call of the representative of the
Governor of Ceylon. The connexion with Ceylon is
formally recognized once a year, when a solemn embassy
comes from Malé, the chief island of the group, to
Colombo, to greet the representative of the Suzerain <span class="linenum">59</span>
Power. So we conclude with this embassy, which has
finally landed us in Ceylon.</p>

<p>In our voyage from the Gulf of Aden to Colombo we
have made a great circuit of the Indian Ocean, yet from
beginning to end we have never lost touch with Indian
trade and Indian people. The islands and ports which
we have visited are only to be understood as parts of a
larger whole, united not divided by the sea. We speak
rightly of the Indian Ocean, since India is and always
has been the central fact in the life of this region, both
politically and economically. This was as true in the
earliest days of the Arab traders as it is to-day. We
have replaced sails by steam, cut the Suez Canal, and
changed the direction of the main ocean route; but as
soon as we pass the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, we find
that our route is only one of many. We are in a network
of traffic and intercourse which was in existence
centuries ago, long before the first European keel broke
into the eastern seas.</p>

<span class="fs80">CEYLON</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Ceylon, which takes the first place among our Crown
Colonies, is the halfway house on our long journey.
As we steam towards Colombo there is little to suggest
that we are nearing one of the chief harbours in the
eastern world. We see a long unbroken line of coast,
fringed with green coconut palms, with no trace of bay
or inlet. In the background rises an irregular hill mass, <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</span>
topped with long ridges and sharp peaks. Presently
we can distinguish two great breakwaters, with a wide
opening between. The southwest wind is blowing and
huge waves are dashing over them, throwing up masses
of foam as high as the masts of the vessels which lie
inside in a great basin, calm as a lake, a mile and a half
long and over half a mile wide. Here is a safe anchorage <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2</span>
for a fleet, with coaling jetties and a dry dock which
can take the largest vessel afloat.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i074.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Colombo Harbour.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Like so many modern seaports Colombo owes everything
to engineering. Forty years ago the roadstead was
open to the swell from the southwest, except for the
shelter of the little headland from which the main breakwater
now juts out. In those days our vessel would
have called at Galle, a hundred miles away at the southern
corner of the island. We can journey to Galle now by <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
railway along the coast, through interminable groves
of coconut palms, with glimpses of the sea breaking on
the coral reefs on our right and Adam’s peak rising into
the clouds on our left. Galle was in early times the
chief port of the island, the meeting point of Arab traders
from the west and Chinese from the east; it is a picturesque,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
old-world town, with many relics of the Dutch
occupation; but Colombo has now taken its place as
the commercial centre. Here is a view of the Galle <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 4</span>
lighthouse, taken from the walls of the old Dutch fortifications;
the building behind the palms is a new
Mohammedan mosque. In a quiet corner we see native <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 5</span>
fishing boats, with more palms in the background. Here
again is a Hindu temple, dating from the time of the <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
Dutch occupation; the lions over the gate may perhaps
have been copied from some European coat-of-arms, as
they look rather different from the usual native devices.</p>

<p>Far away in the northeast is Trincomali, a vast landlocked <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
bay, with unlimited deep and safe anchorage, the
only good natural harbour in the island, in fact one of
the best natural harbours in the whole world. Here
was for many years the headquarters of the Navy in
Indian waters; but it is out of the track of steamers
and away from the capital, so that it has now been
dismantled by the Admiralty. The Navy has followed
to Colombo the commerce which depends on it for protection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and Trincomali, in spite of its great natural
advantages, has sunk back to the position of a third-rate
local port.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Ceylon.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Before we start on our tour let us study the map and <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
form some idea of the shape and nature of the land
which we are about to visit. Ceylon hangs like a pearl,
as the eastern poets say, from the end of India, to which
it is nearly joined by the chain of small islands and reefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
which lie between the Gulf of Manaar and Palk Strait.
So shallow is the passage that large steamers do not
venture through, and proposals have already been
made for carrying a railway across. Ceylon is almost
as large as Ireland; the whole of the north is flat, and
a belt of lowland forty to fifty miles wide runs all
round the east and south coasts. In the southwest the
belt narrows, between the sea and the foothills of the
block of highland which fills up much of the interior.
This block is an irregular plateau-like country, crossed
by ridges from northwest to southeast, cut into by deep
gorges and crowned by sharp peaks, many of which rise
over six thousand feet. The rivers are short and swift,
except where they traverse the broader lowlands of the
north and northeast. The southwest corner, with its
highlands and coast strip and its entrance at Colombo,
is the real Ceylon of to-day; though in former times
the coast and the interior had each a distinct and
separate life and history.</p>

<p>The whole island is represented in the crowd, bewildering
in its variety of face and dress, which greets us on <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
our landing in Colombo. Here is a typical Sinhalese,
wearing the <em>comboy</em>, a wide length of cloth, of white or
striped cotton, which is wrapped round the lower half
of the body; his long hair is done up in a knot behind
and ornamented with a tortoiseshell comb, which gives
a strange appearance to his head. We see this comb, <span class="linenum">10</span>
in its most elaborate form, in the portrait of a high-caste
Sinhalese; and we notice that, except for the comb, he <span class="linenum">11</span>
wears ordinary European dress. Here again is a native
in the street wearing a shawl round his shoulders, and
yet another with a neat drill jacket; the latter is probably
in the service of Europeans. The building behind them
is a native theatre, roofed over with green palm leaves. <span class="linenum">12</span>
Finally, we have a picture of a typical Sinhalese girl of
the lower class.</p>

<p>Then we come on a group of dark-brown men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
wearing loincloths and turbans and repairing the <span class="linenum">13</span>
roadway with pick and shovel; these are Tamil coolies
from Southern India, doing the heavy work of the <span class="linenum">14</span>
town. Another trots in the shafts of a ricksha, the
carriage of the East, which we shall meet again. As
we go further into the town, we meet natives from
the country districts on their way to market in two-wheeled <span class="linenum">15</span>
carts, thatched with leaves of the coconut palm
and drawn by little humped bullocks. They wear the
<em>comboy</em> and little else, as they are less influenced by
foreign ideas than the people of the town. Let us follow <span class="linenum">16</span>
them into the <em>Pettah</em>, or native quarter, with its trams
and rickshas and busy shops. Here we see the carts <span class="linenum">17</span>
collected in the open market place, and in the streets
we notice a new type of men; these are Moormen or
Mohammedans, who carry on much of the business of
the town. Some of them wear the fez, which we see at
times even in our own country; others, more old-fashioned,
wear strange-looking hats shaped like a beehive. On <span class="linenum">18</span>
our way back we pass a Hindu temple, which reminds
us again that India, its people and its creeds are close
at hand.</p>

<p>The Europeans are almost as varied as the natives.
Some are English, officials or planters; others are Dutch
by race; while there are also a great number of half-caste
descendants of the original Portuguese settlers.
Many of the half-castes bear Portuguese names and
imitate European dress and manners.</p>

<p>We can easily see something of the habits of the poorer
classes since they live largely in the public view. Their
houses are wattled huts of mud and bamboo, thatched
with leaves or roofed with red tiles, and open to the
street except at night when they are boarded up carefully,
as the Sinhalese are not fond of the night air. We
may perhaps see a family occupied with the morning toilet,
in front of the house; and here in a corner of the lake <span class="linenum">19</span>
are the <em>dhobies</em> or native washermen at work. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
lake is one of the most beautiful sights of the town; it
is really one of the lagoons which we find all round the
coast, where the mouth of a stream has silted up. The
Dutch, following their home customs, utilized these
lagoons and developed a system of canals along the low
coastline. Part of the system is still in use, and we can
travel by small steamer from Colombo northward to <span class="linenum">20</span>
Negombo. Here is a scene on the canal. The Dutch have
also left traces of their rule in scattered fortifications
and in the Roman-Dutch law which is still the basis
of the legal administration in the island. Many of the
lawyers in the local courts are of Dutch descent.</p>

<p>The Dutch had ample time to leave their mark on
Ceylon, as they held it from the middle of the seventeenth
century, when they wrested it from the Portuguese,
until the end of the eighteenth, when it was handed over
to Great Britain at the time when Holland was subject
to France. The Dutch traders were attracted to Colombo
and the southwest coast by the cinnamon which grew
there; the bark of the cinnamon was the most valuable
product of Ceylon and almost the only export, apart
from elephants, until well into the nineteenth century.
The cinnamon trade was a strict government monopoly,
enforced by harsh penal laws, and the monopoly remained,
even under English rule, until 1832. One other interesting
trace of Dutch rule survives in the many miles of
palm groves, planted by forced native labour, which
we have already noticed along the coast from Colombo
to Galle.</p>

<p>For a century and a half before the Dutch occupation
the island was under the power of Portugal. The wars
of the Dutch were undertaken to advance their trade;
but the Portuguese fought for the idea of Empire, and
one of their chief aims was the conversion of the conquered
races to Christianity. The effect of Portuguese
rule still survives in the coast districts where Portuguese
names are common, in the mixed race and the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
corrupt Portuguese dialect, and above all in the thousands
of natives professing the Roman Catholic religion. The
word Don, formerly a Portuguese title, is still in use among
the natives as a personal name, and many even of the
pure Sinhalese have adopted high-sounding Portuguese
names.</p>

<p>Neither the Dutch nor the Portuguese succeeded in
subduing the highlands of the interior; their occupation
and interests were limited to the coast strip. It was left
to England, in the nineteenth century, to penetrate
inland and build roads and bring the whole of the island
under a single control. We now leave Colombo, and
travel by train to visit the highlands and the old capital
at Kandy, where we shall learn something of the
up-country Sinhalese, who differ considerably from those
of the sea-coast. The line is built on a broad gauge
and the train has a comfortable restaurant car attached
as in England. At the start, we run through mile after
mile of padi fields. The native agriculture is simple:
first the muddy earth is scratched with a primitive <span class="linenum">21</span>
plough, drawn by water buffaloes, which are used in the
fields as the wet mud does them no harm; the crop is
sown with many strange ceremonies, and a little later the
water impounded from the streams is allowed to flow
over the young plants; later still the land is again
drained dry and the ripened grain is reaped by hand.
The Sinhalese are agriculturalists and nothing else;
working on their own land is among them the most
honourable pursuit, though they are not as ready to
work for others. They brought with them from their
original home in Bengal their national taste for rice,
and kept to their former habits, although much of Ceylon
is not well fitted for its cultivation, and great irrigation
works were necessary to provide the water. Even on
the hillsides we still see the padi grown by means of
terraces. On the ridges between the padi fields are
groves of coconut palms; and here and there we come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> <span class="linenum">22</span>
on a native village or house, like the one in front of us,
always with its little group of palms and other trees,
growing without attention and providing for most of
the simple wants of the villager. The leaves provide
thatch for his hut, unless he is wealthy enough to use
red tiles, and are woven into mats or baskets; the stalks
make fences, while the trunks give beams and troughs
and furniture. From the sap he makes sugar and spirits:
the husk of the nut gives fibre for rope: the shell makes
drinking bowls and spoons; while the kernel can be
eaten, or dried as copra and then pressed for the oil, which
is exported to Europe. We have already seen this in
the Seychelles. It is hardly surprising that where
Nature supplies so much without effort on his part, the
Sinhalese is not according to our ideas industrious. To
him the coconut palm is a necessary part of his existence,
and he well expresses this in the saying that the tree
will not grow out of sound of the human voice. But
the coconut palm has another aspect in Ceylon. The
Sinhalese gentry have discovered its commercial value,
and in various parts of the island, especially round
Negombo and Batticaloa, there are large estates where
the nut is grown on the plantation system for export.
There is already a larger area under the coconut palm
in this form than under tea, and the coconut as a commercial
product increases steadily in importance. It
is interesting to note that it is the wealthier natives
and not the foreign planters who are mainly responsible
for the development of this profitable business. In the
northern part of the island we find another species of palm <span class="linenum">23</span>
tree, the palmyra. This palm is almost as important
to the Tamils who inhabit the district as the coconut
is to the Sinhalese further south.</p>

</div>

<p>As we approach Kandy the scenery grows wilder and
the hills steeper, and we may perhaps catch sight of a
different kind of cultivation. Long rows of low bushy
plants are growing in the fields, and scores of dark brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
natives, men, women and children, are picking the <span class="linenum">24</span>
leaves. We are entering the tea-planting district. In
the distance is the planter’s house and near it the sheds <span class="linenum">25</span>
where the leaf is dried and packed for the market.</p>

<p>Here and there, in this part of our journey, we may
notice stretches of desolate scrub breaking up the forest
area. A century ago there was a continuous belt of
forest between Kandy and the lowlands, jealously preserved
by the native kings as a barrier against the invader;
now only patches of this remain. The native
has a method of cultivation styled <em>chena</em>: this consists
in burning a piece of the forest, cultivating it for a year
or two and then moving on to a new patch. The trees
do not grow again, but a low scrub springs up, useless
for any purpose. When the Government interfered
with this wasteful practice the damage was past repair.</p>

<p>We now reach Kandy, a beautiful old-world town, set
in the forest high up among the hills, and full of relics <span class="linenum">26</span>
of past history. Here we see it, looking across the
artificial lake on which it stands; and here is one of its <span class="linenum">27</span>
streets. The people in this district are old-fashioned and
little touched by foreign influence. They still retain
many of the old feudal ideas. Here we have a group of <span class="linenum">28</span>
chiefs, in the picturesque native dress, though the effect
is rather spoilt by the clothes of the Europeans; and <span class="linenum">29</span>
here is a portrait of a chief showing his dress of ceremony
with its elaborate ornaments. These dignified chiefs
are very different from the native as we saw him
at Colombo. All round us are ruins of temples and
public buildings, often half buried in the jungle; but <span class="linenum">30</span>
we can still see the Audience Hall of the old kings of
Kandy, with its carved wooden pillars. It is now used
as a modern Court of Justice.</p>

<p>The Kandyans have a long and notable history behind
them. Two thousand five hundred years ago, according
to native tradition, a prince from the Ganges Valley
reached Ceylon and established himself as king. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
invaders were tillers of the soil, and their rulers have
left monuments of their energy in the many ruins of
irrigation tanks dotted about the dry northern part of
the island. They were not for long left undisturbed
in their conquest. From time to time the land was
raided by the people of Southern India, and the history
of the kingdoms of Ceylon is largely a series of wars.
We can trace the gradual progress of the later invaders
in the removal of the Sinhalese capital further and
further south; first, from the coast to Anuradhapura,
then to Polonnaruwa, and so on to Kandy, and finally
to Cotta, now a suburb of Colombo. As the result of
this movement, the southwest district is to-day occupied
mainly by Sinhalese, who form two-thirds of the native
population, while the northern part is peopled by Tamils
who belong in language, race and religion to Southern
India. The Chinese, who for many centuries traded
with Ceylon and at one time conquered it and carried
away the reigning king, have left no traces; not so the
Arab traders of the West. Their Mohammedan descendants
still form a large part of the population on the
coast, especially on the east side, and throughout the
island they are the shopmen and traders in nearly every
village. So we have Tamils in the north. Sinhalese in the
south and Moormen everywhere; and all mingled together
with Europeans, Burghers and half-castes in the coast
ports and Colombo. There is one other race which we must
not forget. In the jungle of the wild Eastern Province
are to be found the Veddas, the dying remnant of the
people who occupied Ceylon before the coming of the
Sinhalese. There are less than four thousand of these
curious people in the island and their number is dwindling
steadily. Not all are equally backward. Some of them
practise a rude form of agriculture in the forest clearings <span class="linenum">31</span>
and build rough huts such as we see here. Others are
still cave-dwellers, living on wild game which they hunt <span class="linenum">32</span>
with bows and arrows. Here we have one of their rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
shelters and here a group of men with their weapons. <span class="linenum">33</span></p>

<p>There is a variety of religions corresponding to the
variety of races. The Sinhalese are Buddhists; they date
their conversion from the visit of a disciple of Buddha two
thousand two hundred years ago, and the island abounds in
proofs of their thorough adoption of the creed. In Kandy <span class="linenum">34</span>
itself we have the famous temple of the Tooth. Here is
a general view from the outside. We pass through the <span class="linenum">35</span>
entrance gate of massive stone, with finely carved doors;
but the temple within, of which we see a corner here, is not <span class="linenum">36</span>
imposing according to our ideas, in spite of its great sanctity
in the Buddhist world; while the tooth is a piece of ivory
which never came out of a human jaw. We shall see
more of such sacred remains as we journey northwards,
to the lower country and the older capitals of the kingdom,
and chief among them Anuradhapura. Everywhere
are ruins of old monuments half buried in the
jungle; a sudden turn may often bring us to a gigantic <span class="linenum">37</span>
image of Buddha, carved out of the solid rock, or to one
of the curious <em>dagobas</em>,&mdash;bell-shaped solid erections of
brick or stone, sometimes plastered with lime. Each
one of these is supposed to contain some sacred relic
of Buddha. Nearly every temple has its <em>dagoba</em>, together
with a <em>wihara</em> or image house, a <em>Bo</em> tree surrounded
by a platform, and a <em>pansala</em> or house for the priests. <span class="linenum">38</span>
In Anuradhapura are to be found some of the most
famous of these shrines. Here is the Ruanweli, about two <span class="linenum">39</span>
thousand years old, still visited by crowds of devout
worshippers; and here is a nearer view. Again we have the <span class="linenum">40</span>
Thuparama, shining brightly in its coat of lime plaster;
it is the oldest and most sacred of all, and was built by
one of the kings to contain the collar bone of Buddha. <span class="linenum">41</span>
Not far away is a remarkable rock temple, the Isurumuniya;
in the foreground we see the high priest with
his long wand of office, and beyond is another <em>dagoba</em>.
From the summit of the rock above the temple we can
look far and wide over the ancient city, with its ruins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of palaces and temples half buried in the trees, and
imagine something of the life of its first builders. Here <span class="linenum">42</span>
is one of these fragments; notice the finely carved moonstone
at the foot of the steps.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable relic of the past is not of
brick or stone; it is a tree, the <em>Bo</em> tree, sacred beyond
all others, since tradition asserts that it sprang from a
branch of the very tree under which, at Gaya in the
Ganges Valley, Gautama attained his Buddhahood.
If this be really the tree planted in the year 288 <span class="fs70">B.C.</span>,
it is one of the oldest in the world with a recorded history. <span class="linenum">43</span>
At the entrance to the sacred enclosure we pass the stalls
of the sellers of lotos blossoms which the pilgrims buy <span class="linenum">44</span>
to offer at the shrine. Inside is the tree with its raised
terrace and altars piled with flowers, its priests and <span class="linenum">45</span>
groups of worshippers at prayer. It is a very different
scene from the Hindu temple or Mohammedan mosque.</p>

<p>In many of the old buildings of the Sinhalese kingdom
there are elaborate carvings and paintings; here we <span class="linenum">46</span>
have a fine specimen of an interior. Both the buildings
and their ornaments prove that the people were
well advanced in some of the arts of civilization.
But the native arts and crafts are almost dead, killed
by foreign trade and cheap goods. We may still see at <span class="linenum">47</span>
Kandy the weaving of the native or <em>Dumbara</em> cloths,
and the working in silver and brass; but these are <span class="linenum">48</span>
barely kept alive by people interested in the past.
The Sinhalese generally have no industries apart from
agriculture, and even in this they keep to the old and
primitive methods and crops, leaving to Europeans,
aided by imported Tamil coolies, the real agricultural
development of the country. The next generation may
see a change, as the Sinhalese of to-day are learning to
appreciate the value of education. There are over a
quarter of a million children attending the schools provided
or supported by the Government, and a beginning
has also been made with technical training. Here we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> <span class="linenum">49</span>
have a village school, with the classes being held in the
open air, as the building is too small for the crowd of <span class="linenum">50</span>
scholars. But it takes many years of education to
change the ideas and habits of a conservative people,
and it will be long before the familiar figure of the professional <span class="linenum">51</span>
letter-writer disappears from the steps of the
post office.</p>

<p>We must look for modern progress not in the ruined
cities but in the new plantation districts of the hill
country. The railway will again carry us in comfort
through the slopes of the planting country to Niuwara
Eliya, up in the clouds, six thousand feet above the sea,
the health resort of the planters and European residents.</p>

<p>The prosperity of Ceylon to-day is largely due to the
British planter. The plantation industry started not
with tea but with coffee. Though it was grown by the
Dutch in the lowlands, coffee was of small importance
until its introduction into the hill country, in the first
half of the nineteenth century. As the interior was
opened up the crop increased rapidly, so that, by 1870,
Ceylon was exporting over a million hundredweight,
as compared with thirty thousand in 1837. Prices
were high, the railway to Kandy had recently been
opened, new estates were being planted, and every one
thought that the future of coffee-growing was assured.
But at the very moment of greatest prosperity came
the first sign of the ruin of the industry. A minute
fungus appeared on the plants in some districts and
began to spread steadily. At first little notice was taken
of the disease; but it gradually extended to one estate
after another and no remedy could be found; while
Brazil, which was free from the pest, poured supplies of
coffee into the markets of the world and sent down prices
to their old level. A series of very wet seasons completed
the work begun by the fungus.</p>

<p>The planters did not despair. They experimented
with new products, such as cinchona, until they again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
produced too much for the market; but it was tea
which in the end saved Ceylon. The tea-plant was
hardier than coffee and was found to be well suited to
the climate of the hill country, with its alternations of
rain and sunshine. As soon as the planters were convinced
of its value, large areas were planted with tea,
so that between 1876 and 1886 the crop rose from eight
to eighty million pounds in weight. By the end of the
century it had doubled again and entirely displaced
coffee as the staple crop of the island. The whole industry
has developed independently of the native Sinhalese,
by means of foreign capital, foreign direction and
foreign labour; even the very food for the coolies must
be brought in by sea, since the Sinhalese agriculturalists
produce little more than they need for themselves. But
the planters are not repeating their former mistake;
they are experimenting with other crops besides tea, as
cacao and rubber; the latter especially seems to have
a good prospect in the future. The Government also
is assisting in the work. In the beautiful gardens at <span class="linenum">52</span>
Peradeniya, near Kandy, we may see a bewildering
variety of plants. Here is the native bamboo and the <span class="linenum">53</span>
curious talipot palm, which blooms only once after many
years and then dies; here is a specimen in bloom. The <span class="linenum">54</span>
leaves of this palm have a special interest, since they
are used like parchment for writing on; so that the
native book takes the curious form which we see in this <span class="linenum">55</span>
picture. Here, too, are all kinds of foreign plants
being grown to test their fitness for cultivation in the
island. It was in the low-country gardens, connected
with Peradeniya, that the Para rubber tree was first
introduced from Brazil and many experiments made to
discover the best methods of growth and tapping.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
RAINFALL. JUNE-OCTOBER.</div>
</div>

<p>The tea plant and rubber tree need plenty of warmth
and moisture for their growth, and these conditions are <span class="linenum">56</span>
only to be found in part of Ceylon. In Colombo it is
hot and wet for the greater part of the year, but in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
early spring, though still hot, it is dry. Over all the lowlands
there is no winter and summer in our sense of the
terms, but only alternations of wet and dry. In the hills
it is cooler than on the plains, though there is even more
rain; but mainly owing to the structure of Ceylon the
wet and dry seasons occur at different times of the year in
different districts. The district near Colombo has most
of its rain when the Southwest Monsoon blows from the
sea in the summer; in the north and east of the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the winter is the wet season, when the northeast wind
comes down from the Bay of Bengal. Here the rainy
period is shorter than in the southwest, so that the total
fall in the year is less, and the whole country is drier.
The highland ridges, running from northwest to southeast,
at right angles to the course of the winds, form a
rough barrier and division between the two kinds of
climate. At Niuwara Eliya we are not far from the
dividing line. We may drive across a ridge or pass
through a tunnel, leaving clouds and heavy rain behind
us, and come out into clear skies and bright sunshine. <span class="linenum">57</span>
The whole face of the country changes; in place of
forest, plantation and waterfalls, such as we see here, we <span class="linenum">58</span>
find open moor and grassland, or <em>patana</em>, with cattle
grazing as on our own moors. The contrast of seasons <span class="linenum">59</span>
is so strong that the flowering periods of many plants on
opposite sides of the mountains are six months apart, as
they depend on variations of moisture rather than of
temperature.</p>

<p>We have been travelling through many miles of cultivated
land on a comfortable railway; yet in this same
district, in the early nineteenth century, our soldiers on
the march to Kandy had to hew a path through the
jungle and sling the heavy guns from tree to tree. The
railway now extends from one end of the island to the
other; off the main routes we find good roads on which <span class="linenum">60</span>
coaches run; here is one of them carrying the mails,
though its appearance does not suggest very rapid or
comfortable travelling. Along many of the chief routes
motor-cars now run. Improved means of communication
have opened up the interior to the planters and enabled
them to reach foreign markets with their products, and
have given us that effective control of the whole island
which was never attained by the Portuguese or Dutch. The
history and progress of Ceylon under British rule is bound
up with the making of roads and the building of bridges.
With the coming of the road and the railway the elephant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
has declined in importance, though he is one of the most
valuable products of the jungle and one of the oldest
articles of export. Elephants still exist in large numbers
in the island, but they are for the most part kept by the
native chiefs for ornamental and ceremonial purposes,
especially in connexion with religious processions. Here <span class="linenum">61</span>
is a picture of the last great drive; in the background
are the wild elephants just driven into the enclosure,
while those in the foreground are tame and trained to
assist in reducing the new captures to order.</p>

<p>The wealth and progress of Ceylon depend upon its
crops, and the crops can neither be grown nor marketed
without means of transport; but the first condition of
growth in a tropical region is the supply of water. We
have seen how the early kings built great tanks or reservoirs
for irrigation in the drier districts of the north,
so that the land could support a large population. After
the Tamil invasions these great works fell into decay
and became choked with jungle; native villages were
even built inside the old embankments. The Government
is now reviving the policy of the past rulers, and
as more and more of the irrigation works are restored
the waste land of the north will be reclaimed and the
face of the country will change. At present, though
Ceylon is purely agricultural, with no manufacturing
industries and only a little mining for gems and plumbago,
yet the food for the towns and for the coolies on
the plantations is brought over the sea. This is an
unnatural state of affairs; with proper use of its great
resources the island should be able to feed itself.</p>

<p>In the various works of improvement the Government
has more often found the natives a hindrance than a help,
and the administration is necessarily of the paternal
type, though it is modified by the presence of the European
planters and the large class of Burghers, or people
of Dutch descent, in the population of the towns.</p>

<p>Ceylon may be taken as a good specimen of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
highly developed Crown Colony. It is ruled, under the
British Colonial Office, by the Governor and his Executive
Council, consisting of a few high officials. There is
also a Legislative Council made up partly of officials,
partly of representatives of the various races and interests.
As the official element is always in a majority, the Council
is an advisory rather than a controlling body, and does
not in any way compare with our Parliament. The
unofficial members of the Legislature were formerly
nominated by the Governor, but the principle of election
has recently been introduced.</p>

<p>The island is divided into provinces, each under the
charge of a Government agent; but the unit of life
among the agricultural Sinhalese is still the village community,
and the villages are largely controlled on the
native system through their own councils and headmen.
We have interfered as little as possible with native
customs or religion, and in the country districts the
people still keep to their old methods of life. In one
respect they have changed, and not for the better. Now
that there is a settled system of law and justice, they have
discovered a great fondness for litigation; and the
intricacies of land tenure offer fine opportunities for the
display of this trait.</p>

<p>We can make part of our return journey to the coast
by boat, though only a short length of the rivers of the
southwest is of any use for navigation. Our boat is a <span class="linenum">62</span>
curious double canoe with an awning of palm leaves,
and our boatmen are Sinhalese and Tamils. We move <span class="linenum">63</span>
slowly down the Kalu Ganga, past wooded banks and
palm groves, with here and there water buffalo or elephants <span class="linenum">64</span>
bathing, or a native asleep in a curious shelter raised
on poles above the ground; and so back again to
Colombo and its cosmopolitan crowd.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE MALAY REGION</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">We now leave Ceylon, cross the eastern arm of the Indian
Ocean, and turn southward through the Straits of Malacca.
We shall find ourselves in a new world, among
people very different from those that we have met in
the earlier part of our voyage. The key to the understanding
of the whole region is Singapore, a century
ago an unimportant island, though even then a few far-seeing
people realized its magnificent possibilities. The
Dutch, at that time the chief commercial Power in the
Malay Archipelago, were preparing to seize the island
when they were anticipated by Sir Stamford Raffles,
the East India Company’s representative at Bencoolen
in Sumatra. He was the true founder of the modern
city, and it does right to perpetuate his name in its streets
and public buildings.</p>

<p>We may consider Singapore, on its little island, to be <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 1</span>
the capital of the whole region of British Malaya. Of
what does British Malaya consist? In the first place,
in addition to Singapore, there are the British Possessions
on the western side of the Malay Peninsula. In the
north we have the island of Penang, with Province
Wellesley on the mainland opposite; further south,
but grouped with Penang for administrative purposes,
are the Dindings and the island of Pangkor; further
south still is the territory of Malacca.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Malay Peninsula: Political.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The total area of these small fragments is a little over
1,200 square miles, or less than that of the county of
Kent; but outside them the whole of the southern part
of the peninsula, a country about the size of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a><br /><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
is under British Protection. In the extreme south,
opposite the island of Singapore, is the Malay state of
Johor. In the middle is a group of four states, Perak,
Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang, which were
federated in 1895 and are now known as the Federated
Malay States. On the northern boundary are Kelantan,
Trengganu, Kedah and the little state of Perlis; these
by agreement with Siam, in 1909, were transferred from
Siamese suzerainty to the protection of Britain. The
Governor of Singapore is High Commissioner for the
protected Malay States, and under him there are British
residents, advisers or agents in all the States, supplemented
in the Federated Malay States by a large staff of
British officers.</p>

<p>In addition to the territory in the Peninsula, the Straits <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 2</span>
Settlements now include various scattered and distant
islands which have been attached at different times to
the Colony. These are Labuan, off the coast of Borneo,
with the Cocos or Keeling Islands and Christmas Island,
both in the Indian Ocean. The Cocos, about 700 miles <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
southwest of Java, are on the route of steamers sailing from
Colombo to Western Australia, and possess a submarine
telegraph station. They are a mere group of coral atolls,
with a population of a few hundreds, engaged chiefly
in preparing copra from the coconuts with which these
atolls abound. They are still ruled, under the Government
of the Straits Settlements, by the head of the Scotch family,
Ross by name, by which they were first colonized. Christmas
Island, about as large as Jersey, lies some 200 miles
south of Java; it was not inhabited until a little over
twenty years ago, when it was settled from the Cocos.
The attraction here lies in the valuable deposits of phosphate,
though there is also some good timber in the dense
forest which clothes the slopes of the mountain. The
population, of about a thousand, consists mainly of
Chinese miners. Here we see the harbour of Flying-Fish <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 4</span>
Cove, on the north coast, where there is good anchorage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and a break in the steep cliffs which form the coastline; <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 5</span>
and here again is one of the quarries. The island
is a great contrast to the low-lying Cocos banks, with
their groves of palms.</p>

<p>In Borneo there is no strictly British territory other than
the island of Labuan; but the State of Sarawak, whose ruler
is an Englishman, and the remains of the old Sultanate
of Brunei, are under British protection, while the British
North Borneo Company holds its territory under a charter
from the Crown.</p>

<p>The political relations of all these islands and territories
are in charge of the hard-worked Governor of the <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
Straits Settlements, whose home we see in Singapore.</p>

<p>From the time of its cession to us, in 1824, by the
local ruler on the mainland, Singapore rapidly outdistanced
the older settlements of Malacca and Penang;
until, in 1867, after a period of dependence on India,
the whole region started a separate existence as a Crown
Colony, under the name of the Straits Settlements, with
Singapore as the capital. The reason for the rapid
development of this obscure island is evident on the <span class="linenum">(2)</span>
map. It commands the Straits of Malacca and the
southern entrance of the China Sea; the only alternative
is the Strait of Sunda, beyond the Equator, five
hundred miles to the southward. It is the halfway
house between India and China, and its position at a
corner makes it the junction point of all the routes connecting
the Indian Ocean with the Pacific. It is also
the natural collecting and distributing centre for much
of the local trade of the Malay region. As a consequence,
an island less than twice the size of the Isle of Wight,
and with no resources of its own worth mentioning, has
become the site of one of the greatest seaports in the
world.</p>

<p>Singapore is not only a junction of trade routes and
a strongly garrisoned naval base, it is also a meeting
point of different races. The population is a strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
mixture of Chinese, Malays and Indians, with a handful
of Europeans controlling the whole mass. The Chinese,
in numbers, industry and wealth, have been the most
important factor in the growth of the whole region,
and their influence increases every year. The Malays
approach them in numbers, but lag far behind in
intelligence and capacity for work; while the Indian
element, mainly Tamil coolies as in Ceylon, is much
smaller.</p>

<p>The town of Singapore stands on the south side of
the island facing the open sea, and the Old Port is not
well adapted to the needs of modern commerce; large <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
vessels, as we see in this picture, must anchor off shore
in the roadstead and unload into barges. The coast,
where it has not been reclaimed, is low and marshy,
and the old wharves bear a look of neglect and decay. <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
But west of the Tanjong Pagar dock, now Government
property, is Keppel Harbour, a narrow deep-water channel,
protected on the seaward side by two small islands.
Large steamers can moor at the Tanjong Pagar wharves
to take in coal or merchandise, and here we find the
mail boats, British, French, German and others; while
the old harbour and the mouth of the little Singapore
river are crowded with Chinese boats and boatmen,
and with barges bringing goods from the steamers in <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
the roadstead. Here we have a view of a corner of the
wharves in the river.</p>

<p>Let us land and make our way towards the town. <span class="linenum">10</span>
Commercial Square and Raffles Square, with their shops
and business offices, are quite English in appearance,
except for the waiting rickshas and the dress of the <span class="linenum">11</span>
natives. Then we see the cathedral and the cricket
ground, which lies on part of the reclaimed foreshore,
with the Raffles monument in the middle. In another
direction are Chinese shops and a Chinese open-air theatre
with the crowd gathered round it in spite of the rain.
They are used to rain in Singapore. We pass a Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
temple, and more shops, and then on the outskirts of
the town we may light on the suburban villa of a wealthy <span class="linenum">12</span>
Chinese merchant, standing in its own beautiful grounds.
The Chinese are proud of their gardens, and the owner
willingly shows us round. Here is a lake in the garden <span class="linenum">13</span>
with the magnificent Victoria Regia water-lily growing
in it. Everywhere in Singapore the architecture and
the people of the East and West are blended in a strange
mixture.</p>

<p>In the hilly country, outside the city, there is nothing
of very special interest for us. As we are close to the
Equator and have heat all the year round, with a heavy
rainfall, almost any tropical product can be grown on
the island; the Chinese make a speciality of the cultivation
of pineapples, which are tinned and exported. <span class="linenum">14</span>
Here we have a scene in the factory. We need not
explore the country, but a visit to the botanical gardens
will not <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'be waste of time'">be a waste of time</ins>, as it will tell us a great deal
about the Malay region in general. In one corner of the <span class="linenum">15</span>
gardens is a large collection of palms; we have seen
already what an important place the trees of this group
have in the life of the tropics, and we shall meet them
often again. Of even greater interest, perhaps, from
the European point of view, is rubber. Here we find
the Government conducting experiments to discover
the kind of trees most suited to the various districts,
and the best methods of cultivation and preparation;
we shall see some of the results of these experiments
on the mainland of the Peninsula which we are now going
to visit.</p>

<p>We touched at Singapore first as it is by far the most
important of the Settlements: the oldest is Malacca,
which in the time of the Portuguese and Dutch occupation
held the position which Singapore holds to-day.
Under modern conditions it has declined in importance
and ranks below both Singapore and Penang, though
the railway and the rubber industry are now giving new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> <span class="linenum">16</span>
life to this old-world settlement. Here is a glimpse of
the river and here a street in the town; it is picturesque <span class="linenum">17</span>
enough, but we miss the life and bustle which we have
seen at Singapore.</p>

<p>The island of Penang, together with the strip of the
mainland opposite, was leased by us from the Sultan
of Kedah, over a hundred years ago, at a time when the
rest of the coast was more or less under the influence
of the Dutch. The rent is still paid regularly to the
Sultan for the time being. In 1824, we came to an
agreement with the Dutch who withdrew all claim to
the Straits, while we left them undisturbed in the island
region further south. This withdrawal of the Dutch,
and the possession of Singapore, gave us the entire
control of the Straits of Malacca. Since that time there
have been some small additions to the area of British
territory, but our chief work has been to bring the native
States within our Sphere of Influence. The result in
the last century, as we have already seen, was the formation
of the Federated Malay States, governed by their
native rulers with the advice and assistance of British
officials. A British Civil Service, with native and Indian
police, and a regiment of Indian soldiers, under British
officers, assist in the work of administering the Federation.
It is an interesting experiment, crowned by complete
success, in the application of Western ideas and methods
of organization to a semi-civilized people; and a
similar system is gradually being introduced into the
other Protected States. Here is a group of these native <span class="linenum">18</span>
rulers and British officials, representing the two sides
of the combined administration.</p>

<p>Though we read a great deal about piracy and misrule
in the old days, we must not think of the natives of
Malaya as wholly given over to barbarism. The States,
just as in India, had their own form of government and
social organization, long before they came under our
influence. They had their courts, palaces and public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> <span class="linenum">19</span>
buildings. The palace of the Sultan of Selangor, which
we see here, reminds us strongly of some of the magnificent
buildings in India. Side by side with it a British <span class="linenum">20</span>
Residency in the neighbouring State of Pahang seems
an insignificant hut; but the hut represents efficiency
in administration, while the Sikh sentry who guards it
stands for the law and order which we have introduced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Malay Peninsula: Physical.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The past development and future prospects of the <span class="linenum">21</span>
Peninsula can only be understood in the light of its
geography. It has a great length of coastline, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
no part is very far from the sea, while access to the coast
is easy on the west. But a mountain chain, stretching
continuously from north to south, though nearer the
west coast than the east, forms a difficult barrier between
the States on either side, except in Johor, where it spreads
out and becomes lower. The rainfall is heavy all the
year round and the temperature rather like that of the
palm house at Kew Gardens. As a result of these conditions,
forty years ago the whole region of the lowland
was a great jungle, with the Malay inhabitants living
in scattered villages and clearings along the streams
which offered the only means of movement. Before we <span class="linenum">22</span>
came there were no roads except the forest tracks such
as we see here, formed by wild animals and used mainly
by hunters. Now there are good roads all over the
western side of the Peninsula, with rest-houses at intervals,
maintained by Government for the benefit of travellers.
These roads connect the towns of the interior
with the sea or with the lower reaches of the rivers where
they are navigable for large boats; while a trunk road
now runs over the mountains, linking the railway in
Selangor with Kuala Lipis on the Pahang river. Here <span class="linenum">23</span>
we have a scene on this road, with the old native bullock
cart and the modern motor-car side by side. We can
imagine that travel will be slow in these carts; and so
it is; but off the road all movement whatever is impossible.
Besides the roads there is now the completed
trunk railway, running from Johor Bharu, where it <span class="linenum">(1)</span>
connects by steam ferry with the short line in Singapore
island, right along the west of the Peninsula to the coast
opposite Penang. The railway, like the roads, has
branches connecting with ports on the coast, and on the
east side a line is being pushed forward into the State of
Pahang; this will ultimately pass through Kelantan
and connect with the Siamese system. About half-way
along the trunk line, in the State of Selangor, is Kuala
Lumpur, the administrative centre of the Federated States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>When road and rail are not available, our sole resource
is the water, which has always been a vital element in
Malay life. We may travel in canoes of various kinds,
and for long journeys we may hire a roomy houseboat, <span class="linenum">24</span>
such as we see here on the Pahang river. If no
boats are to be had, we may build a raft of bamboo and <span class="linenum">25</span>
on it drift down stream. Our journey will not be without
excitement, as there may be rapids to be negotiated,
and we must be careful where we bathe, as there are <span class="linenum">26</span>
crocodiles in plenty. Near the river mouths and along
the coast we find sailing boats, often of the junk type,
which remind us of China; and the larger ports have
their coasting steamers, owned in some cases by Chinese
capitalists in Singapore.</p>

<p>Malaya, with its warmth, ample rainfall and many
streams, is naturally the land of the rice swamp and
coconut palm. As we travel southwards from Penang,
the rice fields stretch monotonously mile after mile over
the flat lands between the railway and the sea. These <span class="linenum">27</span>
great levels do not make good pictures, but here is one
of them. The native in the foreground is beckoning
eastern fashion, with the hand pointed downwards. The
ditch beside him is an irrigation channel. The water
is impounded in rough reservoirs on the valley slopes
and allowed to flow down to these channels; sometimes,
too, it is raised from a lower level by a primitive water
wheel, with bamboo tubes fixed on its rim as buckets.
Experience has made the native skilful in irrigation
work of this kind.</p>

<p>The rice field, the coconut palm and the river provide
the Malay with an easy living, supplemented in the past
by the proceeds of occasional piracy. He was not likely
to be industrious so long as his property was liable to
be seized at any moment by his rulers or their deputies.
The Malay, as we find him all over the East India Islands,
will hunt, fish, sail a boat or fight with considerable
energy and skill, but he takes ordinary life in an easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
fashion. He has no desire for the business of money-making
and prefers to live in his simple fashion in his
own homestead or <em>kampong</em>. Let us look at some of <span class="linenum">28</span>
these native houses. They are all raised above the
ground on piles, and usually have a kind of verandah <span class="linenum">29</span>
on one side; the interior is dark, as the native is not
fond of windows. We notice the bamboo and the coconut
palm near every house and shall probably come on the
stream not very far away. This is the real Malaya:
the aspect of the towns is very different. Here we find
streets of houses and shops, but these are largely given <span class="linenum">30</span>
up to the natives of India or China, as we may guess from
the signboards in the picture before us. Here, on the <span class="linenum">31</span>
other hand, we see the typical Malay, in his national
costume, the bright coloured <em>sarong</em> or petticoat which <span class="linenum">32</span>
is worn both by men and women, with a light jacket of
some kind to complete the dress. The Malays are Mohammedans,
though not perhaps of a very rigid type. Here <span class="linenum">33</span>
we see the new mosque at Kuala Lumpur, fit to stand
side by side with a palace; but the simple thatched or tiled <span class="linenum">34</span>
buildings which we find everywhere in the villages seem
to agree better with our pictures of ordinary Malay life.</p>

<p>Though the Malay is largely occupied in agriculture,
yet he has taken only a small share in the most important
of recent movements, the artificial cultivation of rubber.
All along the railway, outside the rice swamps, we find
our view shut in by the tall trees of the forest. Here <span class="linenum">35</span>
is a glimpse where the forest has been thinned out a
little, and here again is a corner of the jungle showing <span class="linenum">36</span>
the dense growth of fern and creeper. The constant
rainfall and high temperature which give us the jungle
have been found to be well suited to the growth of the
Brazilian rubber tree. So here and there from the train
we catch sight of a great clearing, with perhaps the young <span class="linenum">37</span>
rubber trees growing amid the roots and fallen trunks
of the older forest. Or again we pass a plantation in a <span class="linenum">38</span>
more advanced stage; and if we pay the planter a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
visit we may see the coolies tapping the trees by slicing <span class="linenum">39</span>
the bark, and collecting the milky latex which when
coagulated and smoked becomes rubber as we know it.
The planter is English, perhaps from Ceylon; the coolies <span class="linenum">40</span>
who cluster round the bungalow to receive their pay
are probably Tamils from India, since the Malay, though
useful in the rough work of clearing to which he is
accustomed, does not take readily to the steady work of
cultivation.</p>

<p>Clearing, planting and growing the trees is a slow process,
and the progress of Malaya would have been far
from rapid if it had been based on agriculture alone.
The money needed for roads and railways came from
another source. When we intervened, we found the
Chinese coolie already in occupation, and a considerable
traffic in Chinese-owned vessels along the coast to Singapore.
The cause of this traffic was tin. Tin ore is everywhere
in the Peninsula, though it is mined chiefly in the
alluvial areas at the foot of the hills. Some of the mining
is still very primitive and is carried on by groups of
Chinese who work with little capital but manage to
make a profit none the less. But in many places modern
machinery has been introduced; the steam pump has
replaced the chain and bucket of the Chinese, while
hydraulic sluicing and other up-to-date methods of <span class="linenum">41</span>
mining are becoming common. We often come on a
whole valley, looking like a huge quarry, turned upside <span class="linenum">42</span>
down and desolated in the search for tin. Everywhere
we notice the busy Chinese coolie, in his curious
sun hat, and in the distance we may catch sight of the
barracks where he lives. The ore is dug out and washed,
and then for the most part sent to Singapore to be smelted
and reduced to the shape in which it reaches our own
country. Nearly half the world’s supply of tin comes
from this narrow strip of country; and we may say that
Malaya has been built up on tin, though now rubber
is rapidly overtaking it in value. The two together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
constitute over nine-tenths of the total exports of the
Federated States and provide a large revenue for the
Government to spend on improvements.</p>

<p>The miner and artisan is nearly always a Chinese, so
that at the present time the Chinese in the Federated
States actually outnumber the natives. If we add the
Indian coolies to the Chinese, we find that out of a total
population of about a million, three-fifths are of foreign
origin. This is how tin and rubber are translated into
terms of population. Outside the Federated States we
do not find the same proportions in the population, though
the geographical conditions are of much the same kind.
There is the same rice cultivation in the coast plains;
the same plantations of coconuts and rubber, though on
a smaller scale.</p>

<p>Trengganu has a considerable textile industry, while
Kelantan exports <em>sarongs</em> to the neighbouring states.
Tin also is everywhere, and some gold; while Europeans
are already mining, prospecting and planting. The population
of Kelantan is almost entirely Malay, and the
native element is stronger than the Chinese all down the
east coast. The whole region is rather more primitive <span class="linenum">43</span>
than the west side; the palace of the Sultan of Kelantan,
with its curious wooden palisade and guard of spearmen,
looks distinctly old-fashioned.</p>

<p>In short, eastern Malaya has been rather out of the
world in the past. The coast is difficult of access; the
river mouths are blocked with sandbars, and there is a
continuous line of surf in the months when the Northeast
Monsoon is blowing. It lies, too, out of the main track
of shipping; so that we have a great contrast to the sheltered
waters of the Straits of Malacca, and it is only
natural that the country behind should be slower to
develop.</p>

<p>The most backward part is naturally the pathless
jungle on the mountains of the interior, which is still <span class="linenum">44</span>
given up to wild game and to the Sakai, naked savages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
living in rough forest-shelters and armed with the blowpipe
and poisoned dart. These represent the lowest
grade among the people of the Peninsula. But development
has begun in the east and the result will be
a change in the face of the country such as we have
seen in the west, brought about by the Chinese and
Indians of the mine and plantation, aided by European
and Chinese capital, and working under sound
administration.</p>

<p>When we turn northwards from Singapore, on the way <span class="linenum">(2)</span>
to China, we are entering a vast enclosed sea, cut off
from the main Pacific by a string of islands almost continuous
for fifteen hundred miles. In the northern part
of this barrier there are a few narrow passages; in the
south the sea is shut in by the unbroken barrier of the
coast of Borneo. Some idea of the size of Borneo, which
is the largest island in the Malay Archipelago, can be
obtained if we compare it with our own islands, mapped <span class="linenum">45</span>
on the same scale. We shall find that Borneo can contain
not only the lands of the British Islands but a large
part of the surrounding seas and channels as well. The
south and southeastern part of this great island belongs
to Holland, so that our visit will be limited to the northern
end; but even in this corner we find a country as
large as Ireland.</p>

<p>After a voyage of seven hundred miles across the
southern end of this enclosed sea, we are approaching the
small island of Labuan, which lies across the mouth of
a broad inlet in the larger island. In the latter part of
our voyage we have sighted land to the southeast, but
this is not our destination, as it is not British territory,
though as regards foreign relations under our protection.
This land is the native state of Sarawak, which is ruled
autocratically by an Englishman, Sir Charles Brooke.
The origin of this State is one of the romances of the
Pacific. Seventy years ago James Brooke, uncle of the
present ruler, made a voyage through the South China<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Sea. He was specially attracted by Borneo and saw
that it might be wealthy and prosperous if only it could
be reclaimed from the misgovernment and barbarism
of its native rulers. The chance soon came to put his
theories to the test. Sarawak, then nominally part of the
Sultanate of Brunei, was in a state of rebellion, owing
to the misrule of a local chief. Brooke, with the crew
of his yacht, helped the Rajah Muda, Hassim, uncle of
the Sultan of Brunei, to restore order; and as a reward
was made governor of Sarawak, in 1841. Thus the
younger son of an Indian Civil Servant became in a
moment an Eastern Potentate. Once established, Sir
James Brooke, or Rajah Brooke as he is better known
to history, not only kept good order in his own district
but joined with the British navy in the suppression
of piracy in the neighbouring seas. As Brunei decayed,
Sarawak grew stronger. Its territory was enlarged from
time to time and its prosperity has proved the benefit
derived by the native inhabitants from strong and firm
control.</p>

<p>An island rather larger than Guernsey, Labuan is the
only British territory, as opposed to a Protectorate,
which we shall find in this region. Rounding a headland
we turn northwards into a broad and deep inlet, and come
to anchor opposite a small town of white houses with
red roofs and a background of low hills; this is Victoria,
the capital and only town. We may have time to travel
by the light railway to the coal mines at the other end
of the island, but we shall find nothing else to detain us,
as the country is mostly occupied by swamps and decayed
villages. The harbour and the coal: these two things
explain why Labuan is now a British Possession. Though
it had been, for a short time in the eighteenth century,
a station of the East India Company, it was unoccupied
and seemingly of little value when we acquired it from
the Sultan of Brunei in 1846; but we looked to its position
on the flank of the great route to China, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
excellent harbour and supplies of coal. It was thought
by some that the island would become a smaller Singapore,
a port of call for shipping and a collecting centre
for the whole mainland of Borneo. Labuan started
with great expectations; its history has been a series
of disappointments. The coal business failed from the first,
while the transit trade did not develop, and the reason is
not far to seek. In spite of the great natural resources of
Borneo, there could be no progress in trade until piracy
and head-hunting had been suppressed and some form
of settled government introduced. Now that this has
been accomplished and the country is prospering and
developing, the mainland has its own seaports from
which the goods are shipped direct to Singapore or Hongkong,
so that Labuan derives no benefit.</p>

<p>Politically Labuan has had a varied career. In 1848,
it was made a Crown Colony, Sir James Brooke being
the first Governor; later it was handed over to the North
Borneo Company to administer for a time; and since
1907 it has been annexed to the Straits Settlements.
It has been eclipsed completely by its greater neighbour.</p>

<p>If we cross the wide bay between the island and the
mainland, we shall get a glimpse of past history, and better
appreciate the reason for the failure of Labuan.
At the southeast corner of the bay we enter the Brunei
river. The forest comes right down to the river bank,
and the trees appear to be growing in the water, with a
tangle of interlaced roots showing above the surface;
we are passing a swamp of mangroves, or <em>bakau</em>, as the
natives call the tree. Then the land begins to rise in
low hills covered still with forest, and the mangrove
gives way to the coconut palm. We pass native canoes
with their double rows of paddles, and here and there
on the bank a group of native houses among the palms.
Finally we round a sharp bend in the river and come <span class="linenum">46</span>
upon the old native town of Brunei. It is a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
eastern Venice, with its houses built on piles driven into <span class="linenum">47</span>
the mud, and its streets all waterways. Here is one of
these streets. In Brunei, as all over Borneo, the bamboo,
the palm and the creeping rattan provide the builder
with material free of charge for posts, flooring, roofs and
lashings&mdash;for the houses are tied, not nailed together.
There is fish in abundance in the river, and we pass a <span class="linenum">48</span>
fleet of market boats, with women in large sun hats,
bringing the catch for sale in the town; while in the
forest all round there is fruit to be had for the picking.
Nature has supplied the Malay with most of his necessaries
at his very door.</p>

<p>Brunei has distinctly an air of decay. Centuries
ago it was a large city, the capital of a kingdom. It gave
its name to the whole island and its rulers extended
their sway across the neighbouring seas. Early voyagers
from Europe seem to have been much impressed
by its barbaric magnificence. Now, all that remains
of a past empire is a small corner of territory, with little
trade or revenue, and ruled in name only by a petty chief.
Most of the territory shown on the old maps has been
ceded to the British North Borneo Company or to Sarawak.
One local industry of some importance Brunei still possesses;
this is the working of brass, particularly of brass
gongs, which still pass as a kind of currency in the interior. <span class="linenum">49</span>
We can visit a whole village of brassworkers, on a creek
close by, and see them working in the open air with primitive
bellows made of bamboo, and producing castings of
old-fashioned design. This is merely a survival; internal
decay and attacks from outside have left Brunei only a
shadow of its former power. The trade with China
and the Malay Archipelago, which contributed to its
former power, was destroyed by the attacks of the
fierce pirates from the islands to the north; and British
influence came too late to save the kingdom from its own
internal weakness; though, under the guidance of British
officials, and by the help of British capital, the fragment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
which remains seems likely to recover some of its
prosperity.</p>

<p>Let us turn from Borneo of the past to Borneo of the
future. We are going to make a voyage round the territory
of the British North Borneo Company. Our trip
will be limited to the coast districts, as much of the
interior is difficult to reach and indeed not yet explored.
First let us see what the map can tell us about the country
as a whole.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i112.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">British North Borneo.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The Company’s territory is in the form of a rough <span class="linenum">50</span>
quadrilateral, with a coastline irregular and deeply indented
by the sea. Inland, but nearer to the west coast
than the east, stretches a long backbone of mountains;
so that the rivers on the east side are longer and the lowlands
broader and flatter than on the west. The Equator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
cuts Borneo almost in the middle, and the whole island is
truly tropical, though there are great differences between
the highlands and the lowlands. The lowlands are hot
all the year round, though the temperature is modified by
the rain and dense vegetation and the nearness of the sea;
so that the climate does not show the extremes of heat
and the great variation which we find in the dry region of
Northwest India, much further away from the Equator.
Again, there are not two strongly marked wet and dry
seasons; rain falls more or less in every month of the
year, though spring and autumn are as a rule the wettest
seasons. A total annual fall of from ninety to two hundred
inches reminds us of the wetter parts of India and
the Malay Peninsula, and combined with unvarying heat
does not suggest a climate particularly adapted to occupation
by the white man. In spite of this drawback the
country is in course of development by British capital
and under British direction. As an estate it is increasing
in value every year. We will now try to see something of
its products and people.</p>

<p>Seventy or eighty miles north of Labuan we enter
another great bay, with a small island at the entrance;
the bay and island of Gaya. On the south side of this
bay is the town of Jesselton, the western capital of the
Territory and the terminus of the only existing railway.
Behind the town is hilly country, and as we approach we
may see in the distance, so far as clouds permit, the great
bulk of Mount Kinabalu, the highest part of the long
mountain chain of the interior. At Jesselton we find
European sports in progress and a mixed crowd is gathered:
natives of the coast region, largely of Malay blood, Sikhs
and Pathans of the Constabulary, with a few Chinese and
the white officials. In the town are the Malay houses
built over the water, and near them a row of Chinese <span class="linenum">51</span>
shops; on the slopes above we see the barracks, with the
Constabulary at drill, and a few European residences,
with Government House overlooking all. At Jesselton we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
have a picture in little of the conditions of the coast
districts.</p>

<p>Before exploring inland we will borrow the Government
launch for a short trip up the coast to Usikaan Bay. <span class="linenum">52</span>
Here is a fine portrait of our skipper. He is a typical coastman;
his mother a native of Brunei, his father from
Sarawak. He is a Mohammedan, like most of the coastmen,
and is full of the lore and legend of the island. We
land at a little pier and enter a shed, which is the Custom
House. There is no sign of inhabitants, as the building is
used only when the local steamer calls to collect the up-country
produce. We have come here to look at the
scenery, not the people, so we climb the hill above the
bay, from which we can look down on the Abai river,
flowing out beyond the next headland. It is a typical
Borneo river. On both banks is the usual tropical swamp,
and all around us is tropical vegetation. Here we can <span class="linenum">53</span>
see the wonderful Pitcher Plant of these regions, though
the finest specimens are to be found further inland towards
Mount Kinabalu. Turning away from the sea we have a <span class="linenum">54</span>
view of the long ridge of Kinabalu, with the upper part of
the Abai river in the foreground. From this outlook we
can gain a very fair idea of the character of tropical
Borneo.</p>

<p>So far we have kept to the outer edge of the island; the
railway from Jesselton will carry us inland, though not
very far, as it runs on the whole parallel to the coast.
The inland terminus of the line is at Tenom, east of Brunei
Bay and behind the coast range of mountains. Here, too,
native sports are in progress, but they are a much more
important business than at Jesselton; they are announced
months beforehand and provide a common meeting-place
for the many native tribes of the interior. The contests
are also especially fitted to the tastes and occupations of
the natives, so that we may learn much from them. The <span class="linenum">55</span>
raft race is one of the most popular, as the rivers are the
only means of traffic in the interior and the natives are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
skilled in handling every form of river craft. Even more <span class="linenum">56</span>
interesting to us is the shooting match <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'with the _sumptian_'">with the <em>sumpitan</em></ins>,
the long blowpipe with poisoned darts which in this region
takes the place of the bow and arrow. Here we find this
formidable weapon put to a harmless use in shooting at
the running deer; it is a kind of native Bisley. The
crowds of spectators show us every type of native face <span class="linenum">57</span>
and dress. Here is a group of Muruts with <em>sumpitans</em>,
and here are some visitors, Sea Dyaks from Sarawak, <span class="linenum">58</span>
whose name is associated with piracy and head-hunting.
The Muruts seem to be the aborigines of this part of the
interior; they are unlike the coast people in appearance
and they are pagans, not Mohammedans; but they share
with the Sea Dyaks their liking for head-hunting, and
would soon revive the practice were British control
removed.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of the railway we begin to find
evidence of the progress of Borneo. One of the most
successful crops is tobacco. Before it can be planted there
is much work to be done. The jungle must first be
attacked and rough roads driven through with ditches at
the side for drainage in the heavy rains. Here we see the <span class="linenum">59</span>
work of clearing in progress. Then wide spaces must be
prepared for planting, and at length we get our crop. <span class="linenum">60</span>
The leaves are then picked by coolies and carried
in curious baskets to the drying and fermenting sheds
for further treatment before they become the tobacco
leaf of commerce.</p>

<p>We will now return to Jesselton and resume our voyage.
A short way up the coast we leave the steamer and take
to a boat; we are going up a small river to attend a <em>tanu</em>
or local market, in order to see something more of
native life. We call on the District Officer at his house
and accompany him in his barge of state to the market. <span class="linenum">61</span>
Here a crowd of natives waits for the hoisting of a little
flag, the signal that they may begin their bargaining.
They have brought down the produce of the interior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
resins, gums and tobacco, to sell to the Chinese dealers;
in return their favourite purchase is brass. There is
also a great buying and selling of fish and fruit. Here <span class="linenum">62</span>
we see a native woman of the hill tribes carrying a large
crate and wearing great coils of brass wire round her waist.
The husband stands by and looks on, as is usual here, where
the women do most of the heavy work.</p>

<p>Once more we board the steamer, and after touching
at Kudat, a fine harbour in the great bay at the north end
of the island, turn southward towards Sandakan, the
capital of the Territory, where we shall end our voyage.
On the deck of the little vessel is a crowd of Chinese
coolies. The Chinese are the real workers on all the coasts
of North Borneo, just as we found them in the Malay <span class="linenum">63</span>
Peninsula. We reach Sandakan, which stands on a
splendid bay running fifteen miles up into the land. The
entrance is only two miles wide, so that the bay is almost
landlocked. Down at the water’s edge is the native
town, with many of the houses built on piles; here too is
the Chinese quarter, and scattered about further up a
wooded slope are the houses of the Europeans. All round
the sides of the harbour are smaller native villages.</p>

<p>Sandakan will probably in the future become an important
commercial seaport, especially in view of its
position on the route between Australia and China. It
already boasts a shipbuilding and engineering yard, and a
cutch factory which sends its products for tanning all over
the world. Here also we may notice timber being floated
down in great rafts for export, especially to China. Not
far away up the river is one of the oldest rubber estates
on the island. Borneo produces many kinds of plants
giving rubber or gutta, but it has been found that the
Para rubber tree of Brazil grows well, and there is a
great future for its cultivation here as in the Malay
Peninsula.</p>

<p>The East India Company made many attempts to
establish factories in Borneo and the neighbouring islands;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
but all came to nothing, so that the early history
does not concern us here. One trace of former conditions
remained in the nineteenth century, in the claims of
Holland in the south of the island and of Spain in the
north. These claims were revived at the time of our occupation
and were not finally settled until the late eighties
of the nineteenth century. The modern history of the
region begins with the acquisition, by an American syndicate,
of certain concessions in the north from the Sultans
of Brunei and Sulu. Their rights were taken over ultimately
by a British company which obtained a charter from
the Crown, in 1881, under the title of the British North
Borneo Company. The charter was a revival of the old
plan for opening up new countries without the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'direct in ervention'">direct intervention</ins>
or responsibility of the home Government. It was
followed by other charters for African companies; but of
these only one survives, and the North Borneo Company is
at the present day the oldest remaining representative of
the system. So we have a large piece of territory under
British Protection but controlled by a private company.
The Company does not trade, but confines itself to
administration, and is supported like any other Government
by duties and taxes of various kinds. It is largely
independent, though the British Government can interfere
if necessary in vital matters.</p>

<p>Malaya and Borneo are tropical estates and can only be
developed by special methods. In dealing with these
estates we have given considerable space to the subject
of administration, since without order and security it is
impossible to utilize those natural resources with which
our geography is concerned. These resources include the
minerals and the whole range of tropical products, together
with the available human material, the Chinese or
Indian labourer and the native Malay. Foreign capital,
British or Chinese, under British direction provides the
driving force for progress. In the different parts of the
Malay Peninsula and in North Borneo we have various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
types of administration and various stages of progress;
but over the whole area there is a general similarity of
conditions which marks it off both from the Indian
Ocean and from the Chinese group which is the object
of our next visit.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE CHINESE STATIONS</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Fifteen hundred miles away from Singapore, guarding
the northern outlet of the China Sea as Singapore guards
the southern, commanding also the approach to the great
commercial city of Canton and to the whole coastline of <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</span>
southeastern China, lies the island harbour of Hongkong,
the last fortified outpost of British power in this
region of the world. The island is only one of a large
group which fringes the coast round the mouth of the
Canton river, and its area is less than thirty square miles, <span class="linenum">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2</span>
or nearly the same as that of Labuan. It consists of a
long irregular granite ridge, falling steeply to the sea,
with deep-cut inlets on its southern side. To the north is
the mainland, with long hill ranges ending in a mass of
rocky peninsulas and headlands. Between the island and
the mainland lies the narrow roadstead or harbour of
Victoria.</p>

<p>As we round the west point of the island, the Peak is on
our right, and below it are warehouses, wharves and piers,
spread out for three miles along the water front. Behind
is the crowded native quarter, and in the background the
city rises in tier above tier of terraced houses up the lower
slopes of the ridge. On the summit, too, we can see many <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 3</span>
houses scattered about. Here is a panoramic view of the
west end of the city, taken from the harbour. Notice the
fine pile of offices and the European Club in the foreground <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 4</span>
of the picture. Our next view, further east, shows the
Admiralty dockyard, which makes an ugly break in the
line of the sea front. The white band on the hill behind
is the cable railway running up to the Peak. We pass merchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
steamers, warships, and crowds of junks at anchor,
and all about us the small native boats or <em>sampans</em> are
plying busily to and fro. Opposite the middle of the
town, where the low peninsula of Kaulun juts out from the
mainland, the harbour narrows to rather more than half a
mile, and here is the ferry. On our left as we enter is Stonecutter
Island, a long bare rock heavily fortified and guarding
the passage; beyond it to the north the view is everywhere <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 5</span>
closed in by the mountain ridges of the mainland.
Here are two views from the hill, showing the west end of <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 6</span>
the harbour, with Stonecutter Island and Kaulun; a third
shows the eastern passage, known as the <em>Lai-i-mun</em>, by <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 7</span>
which we shall leave after our visit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i122.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Hongkong Island.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Seventy years ago Hongkong was a mere rock, inhabited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
by a few fishermen; its sole value lay in its anchorage
beyond the reach of Chinese troops. For two centuries
the East India Company had traded on sufferance at
Canton, but in 1834 its trade monopoly was abolished
and the servants of the Company gave place to a British
official. The Chinese failed to understand the change;
they wished to treat our representative just as they had
treated the merchants. In the end the foreign community
was forced to leave Canton, and we despatched an armed
expedition to support our claim to trade and to place the
interests of British subjects on a secure footing. The war
which followed is often styled the opium war; but the
opium trade was only one item in the quarrel which
involved recognition by the Chinese of international
relations.</p>

<p>Our merchants, driven from Canton, and warned off
from Macao by the Portuguese, who feared the Chinese
and were jealous of our trade, took refuge in the roadstead
of Hongkong, though the Chinese placed batteries on
Kaulun and threatened to fire on the ships. In this way
we first came to the island, which was ceded to us by the
Treaty of Nanking in 1842. In 1860, at the conclusion of <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 8</span>
another war, we obtained full possession of the Kaulun
peninsula, which we had already leased from the local
authorities as being necessary for the security of the
harbour. Finally, in 1898, we leased the New Territory
at the back of Kaulun, amounting in area to about 370
square miles. This was just as necessary under present
conditions as the peninsula of Kaulun had been in the
past, since Victoria with its shipping would be at the mercy
of long-range artillery mounted on the hills of the mainland.
From the first the Chinese people, recognizing the
value of the security given by British rule, flocked to the
island; so that we now have over 300,000 Chinese residents
in the island and peninsula, excluding the leased
Territory, and on the native boats and junks, while the
European population numbers only a few thousand. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Chinese seem to prefer our system of government to their
own. Hongkong is not merely a fortress; it is a free
port, except as regards the importation of alcohol, and
one of the greatest commercial centres in the world; but
without the Chinese its trade could not be carried on for a
single day.</p>

<p>Let us now land and learn something of the city and its <span class="linenum">&nbsp; 9</span>
inhabitants. We stroll along Queen’s Road, the main
artery of the town from west to east, with its offices and
shops and its general air of prosperity. Then we turn off
into a street running upwards from the harbour; it is <span class="linenum">10</span>
Pottinger Street, named after Sir Henry Pottinger, the
trainer of the treaty of 1842. The tall houses and narrow
roadway remind us that there is very little level ground in
Victoria and that space is valuable. We could judge this
also from the general views of the Peak which we saw as
we entered. Trade needs money, and there are various
banks in the city; one of the finest buildings is that of
the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, which is well known in
England and has a large branch in London. If we go into
one of these banks we find that many of the clerks and
cashiers are native Chinese. Here is the entrance to the <span class="linenum">11</span>
Hongkong and Shanghai bank and here is the back of the
great block of fine buildings. The statue in the corner is that <span class="linenum">12</span>
of the late Queen Victoria, and the figures in the foreground
are Chinese women carrying pigs in baskets. The whole of
this area, with its open spaces, including a cricket ground,
and the mass of buildings which we saw from the harbour,
has been reclaimed from the sea. In one of the narrow <span class="linenum">13</span>
streets we may see something of native customs. It is New
Year’s Day, a great festival among the Chinese; all over
the ground there is a litter of crackers, and we may perhaps
see them solemnly firing a huge cracker in front of
some important house as a kind of New Year’s greeting.
At a corner we come on a scene which reminds us of <span class="linenum">14</span>
London: the road is up and labourers are at work, but
here they are Chinese. Down on the water front is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
another aspect of native life. Here we have a large <span class="linenum">15</span>
population living always in covered boats; there are
millions of Chinese living in this fashion on the rivers and
waterways of the mainland.</p>

<p>To see how the Europeans live we must leave the busier
part of the town and climb up the hill. Down below, in
the native quarter, the houses are crowded together and
the air is close. Higher up are trees and gardens and <span class="linenum">16</span>
open spaces. Here is a view from Battery Path, on our
way up. We end our walk at Government House, where <span class="linenum">17</span>
we see the inevitable Chinese gardener at work.</p>

<p>To get a view of the island we must take the cable railway
to the very summit of the Peak. It is much cooler
here and there are many European houses. Hongkong
is on the edge of the Tropics and is wet and warm in
summer, while the town of Victoria is shut off from the sea
breezes by the surrounding heights. But the upper part
of the ridge is open to the Southeast Monsoon winds
blowing in from the sea, and so it is a healthy residence
for Europeans not unlike the hill stations of India.</p>

<p>In the matter of health, the island in past years had
not a good name. On the southeast coast is Stanley, <span class="linenum">18</span>
a primitive little village on a beautiful bay; here is the
spot where the British troops first landed in 1840. Further
west, behind a sheltering island, is Aberdeen, which
was also occupied for a time. But both were found to be
unhealthy and so the troops were withdrawn. Stanley is
a mere fishing village, though the graves of the soldiers and
their wives are there to remind us of the price which we pay
for our Empire. Aberdeen is a little more important, as
it possesses a dock. But its main industry is fishing; and <span class="linenum">19</span>
here we can see the fishermen, watched by an admiring
crowd, dragging out a large rock fish, which will be towed
alive, behind a launch, to the market at Victoria. The
mass of the population of the island is concentrated in
Victoria, which is greatly overcrowded. Much has been
done for health by improved drainage, and the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
reservoir at Taitam, in the southeast corner of the island,
with the concrete channels for gathering the heavy rains
on the hill slopes, provides an ample supply of good water;
but the Chinese have peculiar ideas as to sanitation,
and plague and epidemic diseases are frequent, so that
Hongkong has drawbacks as a place of residence, especially
for European children. Though the hill is cooler than the
town, it is damp, so that many prefer the drier Kaulun
district on the other side of the water. Here a new Victoria <span class="linenum">20</span>
is growing up with busy wharves and docks. Land
is being reclaimed from the sea, and in the surrounding <span class="linenum">21</span>
hills we find granite quarries with abundant material for
the building of docks and sea walls. On a small hill near
the landing stands a curious tower, with masts and flag-staffs <span class="linenum">22</span>
around it. This is the observatory, which watches
the weather and especially gives warning of the approach
of the dreaded typhoons of the China seas. These are fierce
whirling storms which sweep in, usually in the autumn,
from the ocean to the south-east, and then curve northwards
along the coast of China towards Japan, carrying
ruin in their track. In 1906, the warning failed to come:
many large steamers were sunk or driven ashore; trees
were rooted up and buildings beaten to the ground, and
enormous damage was done to the piers and quays on the <span class="linenum">23</span>
water-front. Here is the signal which is hoisted to give
notice of the coming of a typhoon.</p>

<p>Behind Kaulun is the New Territory: a land of mountain
and torrent, with here and there a broader valley <span class="linenum">24</span>
with fields of rice and sugar-cane. Here we see some
of these rice fields on the route of the new railway. <span class="linenum">25</span>
Notice how the ground is flooded. The population, about
100,000 in all, is not very dense and is grouped in scattered
villages. Here is a view of the picturesque country at the <span class="linenum">26</span>
back of Kaulun, with a cattle depôt in the foreground to
remind us that the city must be fed from the surrounding <span class="linenum">27</span>
country. Here again we see a street in Tai-wo-shi
and a group of villagers gathered round the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> <span class="linenum">28</span>
well. Let us pay a short visit to Wun-yin, or “Pottery”
village, for a glimpse of a native industry. We see a <span class="linenum">29</span>
potter at work, painting the little bowls, but he does
not look quite the same as the ordinary Chinese of the <span class="linenum">30</span>
south. He is a <em>Hakka</em>, as is also this native woman,
who does not seem in the least nervous in front of the
camera. Neither is handsome, but they are very useful
in Hongkong, since they do much of the hard manual
work which is necessary in a great port. The <em>Hakkas</em> are
immigrants, of a different race from the natives of the
Canton district, and they have different habits. Among
other peculiarities they do not bind the feet of their women.</p>

<p>In the New Territory we are already changing the face
of the country. Water is being impounded in great <span class="linenum">31</span>
reservoirs for the supply of Kaulun, and a railway twists
and burrows through the valleys and mountains, and
connects at the frontier with the Chinese railway to
Canton. So the Territory has a future of its own, but
its real importance is as a protecting barrier to the
harbour of Hongkong.</p>

<p>Hongkong is an excellent instance of the attraction
which a free port, under a Government which gives security
for life and property, and deals out even-handed
justice, has for an industrious native race. The liberality
with which the wealthier Chinese support public objects
in Hongkong, such as schools and hospitals, is the best
proof that they appreciate the methods and value of
British rule.</p>

<p>The close connexion which has always been maintained
between Canton and Hongkong, and the fact that the
British Concession at Canton is an interesting survival
from an earlier stage of our relations with China, justify
us in paying a flying visit to that city before continuing our
voyage northwards. So we board one of the small local
steamers and pass up the broad river, with the old forts
on its banks, which more than once have been bombarded
by our fleets, until the growing crowd of native shipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
tells as that we are approaching the great commercial <span class="linenum">32</span>
city. Here are junks and sampans packed together or
moving slowly about the river, and huge shallow-draught
steamers, resembling pictures of the old boats on the
Mississippi, fifty years ago. We land at last on the <span class="linenum">33</span>
Shameen, the British settlement outside the walls. It
was originally a mere mud bank, facing the main river
and protected by a narrow creek at the back. Now it <span class="linenum">34</span>
is laid out as a European town, with open spaces, a church,
and European houses and gardens. Here is a view of the <span class="linenum">35</span>
creek with the English bridge. Across the creek is
a Chinese suburb, thickly packed with native houses, <span class="linenum">36</span>
and beyond are the high walls of the vast city with its
million of turbulent people. We cross the bridge and
make our way to the massive gates; if we are wise we
shall take a guide with us. From the top of the old wall
we look down over a sea of roofs, with here and there a
fire lookout or a huge building, a pawnshop, showing
above the general level. Hidden below is a mass of
narrow and winding streets, and far away, in the very <span class="linenum">37</span>
midst of the city, towers the great Flowery Pagoda. Just
below it is a building which we must visit, the old British
Yamen, at one time the residence of our officials, though
they now prefer the greater comfort of the Shameen.
Here, in the heart of Canton, in the former palace of a
high Chinese official, we established a British representative.
It was a great change from the days when British
merchants carried subservient messages to the city gates
and the Chinese refused to interview or in any way recognize
British officials. This interesting building is of great <span class="linenum">38</span>
significance in the history of our relations with the great
Empire of the East. Here are two views of the Yamen; <span class="linenum">39</span>
we seem to be very much in the heart of China.</p>

<p>Canton has, to some extent, lost its former importance
for us, and its merchants no longer have the monopoly of
the whole external trade of China; so we return to Hongkong
without further delay, and rejoining our ship steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
out through the narrow eastern passage, the <em>Lai-i-mun</em>,
and turn northwards on our voyage.</p>

<p>Our next port of call is Shanghai, a most important <span class="linenum">(1)</span>
centre of British trade and influence and in close connexion
with British stations in the East, though not one of them
itself. Hongkong is the great exchange station for shipping
and trade in the Far East; Shanghai is the market
and business centre for the great basin of the Yangtse
river and for much of North China as well. Its importance
may be measured by the fact that over half the total trade
of China passes through the hands of its merchants.
There are two Shanghais, and the contrast between them <span class="linenum">40</span>
is great; on the one hand we have the old native walled
city, dirty and decaying and purely Chinese, and on the <span class="linenum">41</span>
other the new Foreign Settlement, where all the business
is done. This part has grown steadily in size and prosperity.
The French still have entire control of their own
section, but in the International Settlement, which was
at one time purely British, Germans and Americans have
now a considerable share. We have here a very curious
system: a foreign municipality established on Chinese
soil and governing itself, subject only to the control of the
foreign Consuls and the Ministers at Peking. It is responsible
for a few thousand Europeans and over half a
million Chinese. At Hongkong we are supreme in everything;
but at Shanghai, though the citizens of foreign
nations are subject to their own laws, the city is still
legally part of China, so that the natives are under the
jurisdiction of Chinese officials. This has been the cause
of great trouble in the past, as Chinese and Western ideas
of law are widely different. It is a very strange position.
Here is a small body of foreign merchants, practically unprotected,
in the midst of a vast native population, yet
responsible for the well-being of one of the greatest commercial
cities in the world.</p>

<p>Trade is the sole foundation of this new Shanghai, and <span class="linenum">42</span>
trade depends on the river Hwangpu; for though Shanghai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
is the outlet for the Yangtse basin, it stands at some
distance from the main river and the sea, at the head of
the tideway of a small tributary and in close contact with
a great network of canals and rivers in the fertile country
to the west. The bank of the river is lined with
wharves, warehouses and factories, and the Settlement
is spreading steadily down towards Wusung. The flat
country round has been built up of silt brought down by
the main river; centuries ago Shanghai may have been
on the coast. The river is still at work: great banks are
formed under water, and in a few generations become dry
land thickly populated. In the whole breadth of the
Yangtse mouth there are only two channels navigable by
large vessels. Everywhere the land is gaining on the sea.
Into the broad silt-laden estuary the little Hwangpu
empties itself below Wusung; it brings down no silt, but
the incoming tide sweeps in the muddy water of the main
river. The silt is dropped and the stream is too weak to
scour it away. At the mouth of the Hwangpu is a great
bar, which is still growing; and so much has the channel
changed and shallowed that it is no longer safe for the
largest vessels to approach Shanghai. We may see
the same process going on in England, in the Humber and
the rivers flowing into the Wash. The Chinese are at last
beginning to move; a new channel has been cut for traffic
on the Hwangpu; the bed of the river has been dredged
and its course straightened, and an embankment built to
keep out the silt from the main river. But the size of
the vessels engaged in trade increases every year and the
future of Shanghai is in the balance; it remains to be
seen whether modern engineering will win the day against
the vast forces wielded by the Yangtse. Any decline in
the activity of Shanghai would be likely to result in more
business for Hongkong.</p>

<p>We leave Shanghai for the last stage of our long voyage <span class="linenum">43</span>
from Europe. As we steam northwards, the coast on our
left is low, fringed with banks and without harbours or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
inlets; it is the edge of the great alluvial plain of China.
But on the second day we come in sight of high bare cliffs,
backed by dark mountains. We are approaching the
promontory of Shantung, an isolated block of highland,
cut off sharply by the sea on its eastern edge and sinking
on the west to the shifting beds of the Hwang-ho and the
maze of waterways which covers the great plain. Towards
the southwest corner of the peninsula lies Kiaochau,
now a possession of Germany; in the middle of the
north side is the old Treaty Port of Chifu; and between
Chifu and the extreme eastern point of the promontory
is the bay and port of Wei-hai-wei. The map
shows us that north of Shantung the coast again becomes
low and uniform, difficult of access and without good seaports;
but a hundred miles away, across the water, another
mountainous peninsula, Liaotung, stretches out
to meet Shantung, where a string of little islands partly
bridges the broad channel. In Liaotung, as in Shantung,
are headlands and deep inlets and harbours; here we have
Port Arthur and Talienwan. The two great promontories
seem framed by Nature to guard the approach to the Gulf
and the capital province of China. On the one, two foreign
Powers are established by diplomacy; two more have
fought for the control of the other.</p>

<p>We steam round the eastern headland, with its white <span class="linenum">44</span>
lighthouse nestling below the gloomy hills, and soon a wide
bay begins to open out ahead of us. We have reached
the end of our voyage. The bay forms a rough semicircle,
about six miles across, ringed in by hills to the south and
west, but open to the northeast, except where for two
miles across the entrance stretches the island of Liukung,
hilly in the west but tapering off to a long low reef in the
east. The island and the northeastern bend of the mainland
enclose an anchorage sheltered from the northerly
gales which sweep in from the sea in winter. This is the
harbour of Wei-hai-wei. In the midst of the broad southern
channel, a mere dot upon the water, is a rocky islet, <em>I-tao</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
or Sun Island, crowned with the ruins of strong fortifications.
There are other such ruins on the high ground to
the north and south, commanding the two entrances to
the bay. These relics contain the history of Wei-hai-wei.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i132.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Wei-hai-wei.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It was here that the Chinese fleet, during the war with
Japan in 1895, took refuge after the loss of Port Arthur and
the defeat off the Yalu. Japanese troops landed further
east and captured the forts on the mainland, while their fleet
attacked the booms drawn across the wide entrances. The
nearness of the mainland was a source of weakness to the
island and the Chinese fleet; and Admiral Ting, assailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
both from land and sea, was at length compelled to surrender,
so that Japan now held the two defences of the
passage-way to Peking, and China’s case was hopeless.
Early in 1898, Germany obtained a lease of Kiaochau,
as compensation for the murder of some missionaries; a
few weeks later Russia seized Port Arthur, and in July
of the same year Wei-hai-wei was leased to us. It was
not merely by chance that the three events followed one
another so closely.</p>

<p>Wei-hai-wei was adopted as a naval base and for the
protection of our commerce, since Hongkong is over a
thousand miles away. The control of a considerable
zone on the neighbouring mainland is necessary for the
security of the harbour, so that the leased territory covers
in all an area of 285 square miles, or about twice the
size of the Isle of Wight. The case is like that of Kaulun. <span class="linenum">45</span>
We are fortunate in the time of our visit, as the fleet is at
anchor in the bay and the crews are practising mining
operations; but at another time we might find the place
deserted. There is no permanent garrison, as Wei-hai-wei
is only to be used as a flying base and practice
ground for the fleet. On the island are the marine <span class="linenum">46</span>
barracks, which remind us of England, and the naval
hospital, which looks quite Chinese, in spite of its English
occupants. The hospital is the more important, since
our squadrons in the Eastern seas have great need of a
sanatorium, and Wei-hai-wei, with its temperate climate,
is the most healthy of all our positions in this part of the
world. There is a cricket pitch on the parade ground and
English sailors are everywhere to be seen in the little town;
but we turn a corner and come upon a building which is <span class="linenum">47</span>
peculiarly Chinese, an open-air theatre, to remind us that
we are merely visitors among a foreign people with customs
very different from our own. Let us climb the hill towards
the golf links, and crossing over look down on the
northern channel. There is no town here, as the shore is
rugged and unsheltered and lashed by heavy seas in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
winter storms. The island is a natural breakwater and
this is the seaward side.</p>

</div>

<p>We will now cross in the steam launch to the mainland <span class="linenum">48</span>
and step ashore at Port Edward. Here is a general view of
the new town, with its ugly modern hotel and its European
houses scattered about the lower slope of the hill. The
territory on the mainland is rather more interesting than <span class="linenum">(44)</span>
the island. It is little more than a strip, ten miles wide,
along the coastline of the bay, though we have certain
rights over a larger area. Mountain ridges, rising to over
a thousand feet, with sharp peaks still higher, cross it from
west to east, dark and bare with deep-cut ravines which
are torrents in rainy weather. A low isthmus divides the
high ground round Port Edward from the main mass of
the Territory; through it runs the new road towards Chifu,
and at its eastern end, close to the sea, stands the Chinese
walled town of Wei-hai-wei, from which the whole district
takes its name. Far away in the southwest are the high
mountains of Chinese Shantung. The old city, though
within sight of Port Edward, is not like the surrounding
territory under British control. Let us pay it a short
visit to see what a Chinese provincial town is like. We <span class="linenum">49</span>
can go in by the eastern gate and look along the street
and visit the temple of Confucius, the great Chinese <span class="linenum">50</span>
teacher and philosopher, who was a native of the Shantung
province. Much of the space within the walls is not built
on; the whole town seems sleepy and decaying, and our
ideas as to cleanliness and sanitation are quite unknown
to the Chinese. In the British area there are no such
towns, but hundreds of little agricultural villages scattered
about in the low-lying parts of the country. The
Chinese peasant here is very different from the coolie or
shopkeeper of Hongkong and is governed in a very different
way. A Civil Commissioner, assisted by a few Europeans
and a small force of police, is responsible for the
control of over 150,000 Chinese. At one time there was <span class="linenum">51</span>
a regiment of soldiers, recruited from the natives; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
this force was disbanded, some of its members became
police. Even in the central offices many natives are
employed on the staff, while the villages practically
rule themselves through the local headmen. Here we <span class="linenum">52</span>
have a portrait of a typical headman, and here a group
receiving medals as a reward for good service. The <span class="linenum">53</span>
Governor of Shantung is the nearest high official representative
of China; and we may see him here in his <span class="linenum">54</span>
chair of state on his way to pay a formal visit to the
Commissioner. Here again is a group of the two high <span class="linenum">55</span>
officials and their respective staffs. We are a long way
from those early days, in the middle of the nineteenth
century, when Chinese officials refused even to write to our
representatives on terms of equality.</p>

<p>Let us now see something of the natives and their
occupations. It is market day in Port Edward; the
streets are alive with crowds, buying, selling and haggling, <span class="linenum">56</span>
and crowding round the food stalls with their piles of
strange delicacies in bowls and saucers. In one corner
they are bargaining for pigs, in another are piled loads of
fuel, scrub oak and fir, brought in from the country round
on the backs of donkeys and mules. There is no coal, and
the peasant has stripped the country of most of its woods,
here as in other parts of China. Here again we have a <span class="linenum">57</span>
village market and a group of peasants with sacks of grain
and bundles of brushwood for sale. Outside the village <span class="linenum">58</span>
they are threshing the grain in a primitive way with a
roller, and drying peanuts on the threshing floor. Everywhere,
on the banks of the streams, we find the village <span class="linenum">59</span>
washing-places, where clothes are washed and pounded in
the fashion which the Chinese adopt all the world over. <span class="linenum">60</span>
Down on the shore we see the fishermen cutting up sharks
for the fins, which are greatly prized by the Chinese as a
relish. <em>Mat’ou</em> was a fishing village on the site of the
present port before the Japanese occupation, and fish of
all kinds swarm in the neighbouring seas. Agriculture
and fishing are still the main business of the people. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> <span class="linenum">61</span>
true that here at Port Edward we see them repairing
junks, and a great quantity of timber is lying about;
but the timber must all be brought from the Yalu river, <span class="linenum">62</span>
and the old iron which is piled near has been salved from
the sunken warships at Port Arthur. Notice the pony,
with his load of brushwood, in the foreground. There
are as yet no materials for local industries, and it does not
seem likely that Wei-hai-wei, in its isolated corner, will
grow into a great commercial centre. None the less we
may see an important European settlement develop on
the site of the old native fishing village. It is not too
far away from Peking and Shanghai; the rainfall in the
year is about the same as in London, though there are far
fewer rainy days, as the rain falls more in heavy showers;
while the summer is dry, and cooler than in most of China.
There is already a school for European boys at Port
Edward, and it seems well fitted as a summer watering-place
for those whose work takes them to the Far East.
In winter it is less pleasant. The northern gales bring <span class="linenum">63</span>
snow, as we see in this picture, and the cold is so severe
that the thick ice is collected, as in northern Europe, to
be stored for use in summer.</p>

<p>We have visited Canton and Shanghai because there
we find a few Englishmen, living on Chinese soil, but under
their own laws and with certain limited powers of self-government.
In Shanghai, even these privileges are
not exclusive, as they are shared with other foreigners;
and they do not imply any interference with the political
sovereignty of China. Wei-hai-wei and the New Territory
behind Kaulun we govern, but only on lease;
Hongkong and the peninsula of Kaulun alone are ours
in full possession. So we return to Hongkong, as the
last outpost of British power in the Far East and the
real terminus of our voyage.</p>

<p>Let us pause here, on the outer rim of our Eastern <span class="linenum">64</span>
Empire, and try to realize its position with reference to
the great lines of the world’s traffic. South of us lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the route which we have traced from Singapore and India;
while another route, as yet in its infancy, leads past
Borneo to Australia. Across the Pacific, from the eastward,
come the steamers from British Columbia and San
Francisco; and soon, when the Panama Canal is finished,
there will be direct communication from the Atlantic
seaboard of the United States. So we see a great concentration
of routes on our Eastern Empire, in the region
where the influences of India and China meet and overlap.
The key to this frontier region is in Singapore, but behind
Singapore lies India.</p>

<p>We have approached India from the northwest, by
the passage of the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal;
and we have seen how our interests in the Mediterranean,
at first purely European, have become more and more
related to the control of the seaway to India. Southwest
is the older route, by way of the Atlantic and the
Cape, a route still valuable for some purposes. Here the
control of the route led us on to the occupation of the
neighbouring mainland of Africa. Southeast again we
reach Australia, either directly across the ocean or threading
the island group of Malaya; while the Indian Ocean
has its own system of minor local routes. So we have
lines of traffic from every part of the world converging
on the Indian region, with its vast trade and swarming
population; the natural junction of all these sea roads,
great and small, is Colombo, close to the mainland
of the Peninsula, yet at the same time well out in the
open sea, the centre of control from which India
reaches out in every direction and dominates the
Indian Ocean.</p>
